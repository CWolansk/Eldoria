- Location : TBD 
	* In General this will most likely take place as the party is exiting the Highreach Mines 
* Description : As you are leaving the mines you suddenly hear shouting from all around you. And you can see 6 men jump out from their hiding spots around the mine entrance. All of which have their faces covered. As they jump out to surprise you, one of the men that stands about a foot taller than the rest, shouts out "Leave your valuables on the ground, and we might let you live". 
	- Even if they put their valuables on the ground the large man will instruct the bandits to attack. 

- Encounter : A group of low level bandits led by one of two twins under the employ of the merchants guild 
	- [[Private/2. Reference/NPCs/All NPCS/Gareth Ironbrow]] will lead the attack along with 5 low level bandits.
		- Gareths first turn he will make a gesture and activate the poison that everyone who ate breakfast ingested. 
			- Julie, Justin and Liz immediately start retching and take -1 to all saves for 1 minute 
	- Gareth will lead the attack and should be almost impossible to take down. 
	- The low level bandits should be very easy to take down and if more than half of them are killed the rest of the bandits will attempt to run away and should be stopped and intimidated by Gareth to keep fighting. 
		- Gareth will either physically stop them or shout at them with his reaction 
	- Gareth will have two actions per round 
- Outcomes : 
	- Party wins fight 
		- If the party wins the fight they can loot Gareth Ironbrow and the bandits. 
			- While the party is looting the bodies Alistair rolls up on his way out of the city and tries to hide his surprise and then thanks the party immensely for stopping the bandits that surely would have ravaged his travelling party. 
			- [[Party Defeats Merchants Guild Bandits]] 
				- Alistair is on his way to [[Ardenville]] early to set up for watching the boat race since he is a sponsor of the event and needs to make sure that everything gets set up correctly. 
	- Party loses fight : [[Party is saved by Alistair Goldman]]
		- This is the most likely outcome unless something crazy happens. The party should wake up in a church within the adventurers guild being tended to by clerics. 
			- The party is informed by the head priest [[Private/2. Reference/NPCs/All NPCS/Father Eldon Lightbringer]] of where they are 
				- Non denominational church within the adventurers guild
			- They received the finest care and their healing fees were taken care of by [[Alistair Goldman]]
