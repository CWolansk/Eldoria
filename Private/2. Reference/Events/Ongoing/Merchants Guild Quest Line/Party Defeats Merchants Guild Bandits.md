- Session 7 Notes  ^4b792a
	- Party meets Alistair and goes back to the city with him 
		- Liz rode on top of the carraige 
		- Julie says she has parkinsons 
		- Party agrees to 
			- 2000 gp each if they reach the bottom within 10 days [[Lake Arden Boat Race]] same day 
			- 1000 gp if they take longer 
			- 10% off all items at [[The Dragons Breath Forge]] 
		- [[Party due date for Alistair Goldman]] 

- Unlikely to happen but if the party defeats the bandits Alistair will roll up around the corner with his bodyguards and in a horse and carriage
	- [[Private/2. Reference/NPCs/All NPCS/Garrick Ironbrow]] is inside the carriage with Alistair and will not get out. 
- Perception check to notice a Large broad shouldered man that bears a more than passing resemblence to the large man that just attacked the party 
- Alistair exits the carriage and we carry on with the conversation they would have had if he had "saved" them 

## **Block A: Alistair’s Greeting**

**Alistair (stepping out of the carriage):**

> “Ah, my adventurer friends! Are you all ok? (without waiting for them to answer) Good, good. Glad you could defeat those ruffians, they must have been after those previous goblin ears of yours eh? 

_(He flashes a thin smile, clearly satisfied with his own remark.)_

# Block B: Offers them a ride back to the city and medical care 

# Block C : If they refuse the ride
If they refuse the ride back to town alistair will be truly disappointed but will accept their choice. Before he goes he askes them to reconsider and threatens them? 
Or he tries to coerce them saying he had another job for them to do and he is willing to be very generous. They just need to get in his carriage and talk about it. 

# Block D : If they accept the ride 
Transition to the conversation in [[Party is saved by Alistair Goldman]] 

## **Block E: Hinting at the Bodyguard’s Identity**

**If players look at or ask about the tall bodyguard:**

> **Alistair (shrugging slightly):**  
> “He’s been in my employ for some time. A quiet professional, but quite effective when the need arises. Don’t let his size alarm you; he only draws that greatsword when absolutely necessary.”

**If they suspect or outright accuse him of being related to their attacker:**

> **Alistair (raising a brow):**  
> “Goodness, do you take every broad-shouldered man to be your nemesis? Perhaps you took a harder blow to the head than the healers realized. Still, I’m grateful he showed up when he did.”
