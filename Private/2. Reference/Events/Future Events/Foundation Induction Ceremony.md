# Foundation Street Induction

## Read-Aloud Text
As you walk through the cobblestone streets of Highreach during the post-crisis recovery, the aroma of hearty soup draws your attention to a humble food cart. An elderly man with kind eyes and weathered hands ladles steaming bowls for weary citizens rebuilding their city. His cart bears a simple wooden sign reading "Foundation Soup Kitchen - Free for Those Who Served." When he spots Justin and Vanessa, his eyes twinkle knowingly as he beckons them forward with a warm smile.

## The Encounter
[[Private/2. Reference/NPCs/All NPCS/Elder Rowan]], disguised as a charitable soup vendor, approaches Justin and Vanessa specifically. This is a **social encounter** designed to secretly induct them into the Foundation.

### Setup
- **Location**: Busy street corner in Highreach's merchant district
- **Time**: Three days after the Duplirat Crisis, during daylight hours
- **Cover**: Elder Rowan operates a legitimate soup kitchen for crisis volunteers
- **Witnesses**: Plenty of civilians around, but none paying special attention

### The Induction Process

1. **Free Soup Offer**: Elder Rowan offers them each a bowl of hearty soup "for your service to the people"
2. **The Discovery**: At the bottom of each bowl lies a small, plain rock pendant
3. **The Test**: When they discover the rocks, Elder Rowan quietly asks: "What do the common people smell?"
4. **The Response**: If they engage, he teaches them: "Only what the rock is cooking."
5. **The Explanation**: He quietly explains the Foundation's mission while they finish their soup

### Multiple Approaches
- **Accept Immediately**: Shows trust in helping civilians, perfect Foundation mindset
- **Ask Questions**: Elder Rowan explains carefully, assessing their commitment
- **Decline**: No pressure; he simply says "keep the stone as thanks for your service"
- **Report to Authorities**: Would break cover but Rowan has legitimate permits

### Character Integration
- **Justin**: His merchant background recognizes the value of networking and civilian connections
- **Vanessa**: Her protective instincts align perfectly with the Foundation's mission

### Immediate Consequences
- **If Accepted**: Gain Foundation membership, rock pendants, secret catchphrase knowledge
- **If Declined**: No negative consequences, but miss the opportunity
- **Either Way**: Begin seeing other Foundation members in the community

### Long-term Consequences
- **Foundation Network**: Access to civilian protection missions and information
- **Safe Houses**: Emergency shelter and support in any major city
- **Political Neutrality**: Foundation membership transcends kingdom politics
- **Future Recognition**: Other Foundation members will know them by their pendants

## DM Notes
- This scene emphasizes the Foundation's focus on quiet, humble service
- The soup kitchen provides perfect cover for the secret meeting
- Elder Rowan's genuine charitable work reinforces the Foundation's values
- The pendant discovery feels like finding a prize rather than receiving a formal badge
