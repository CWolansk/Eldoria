## Physical Description

Middle-aged with a robust build, short brown hair showing early grey, perpetually welcoming smile that doesn't quite hide the stress lines around his eyes.

## Personality

Diplomatic and pragmatic, desperately trying to balance competing interests while preserving village traditions. Shows genuine care for his community while struggling under political pressure from all sides.

## Background

Descendant of the Hearthwood family who founded Hillcrest 287 years ago during the Border Wars. Married to [[Seraphina Winecraft]], the village's master vintner. Has inherited both the responsibility of leadership and the legacy of his family's role in establishing the village's wine-making traditions.

Central figure in the Hillcrest vineyard crisis. His decisions regarding the three competing factions (traditional vintners, Merchants Guild, political moderates) will determine the village's future and the party's potential allies in the region.

## Notes

Knows the current vineyard blight has a magical nature but fears admitting this publicly would cause panic and economic collapse.

### Attitude toward Party Members
- **[[JP Player Sheet]]**: Initially cautious due to racial prejudice but quickly recognizes competence and dedication
- **[[Justin]]**: Views as potential ally due to merchant experience and trade connections
- **[[Julie]]**: Eager for her archaeological expertise regarding historical blights and village defenses
- **[[Private Claire notes]]**: Hopeful her divine magic might provide solutions to the supernatural aspects of the crisis

**TODO**: Develop specific dialogue options, personal quest hooks, and potential character development arcs

## Relationships

- **Spouse**: [[Seraphina Winecraft]] - Master vintner and voice of reason
- **Childhood Friend**: [[Benedict Vineward]] - Leader of traditional vintners
- **Political Rival**: [[Eliza Brightwine]] - Merchants Guild representative
- **Ally**: [[Guard Captain Roderick Stone]] - Village security chief
