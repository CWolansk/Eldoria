## Physical Description

Tall and slender, auburn hair tied in practical bun, green eyes that spark with enthusiasm but harden during business negotiations. Dresses in well-made but practical clothing befitting a guild representative.

## Personality

Ambitious and efficiency-focused, genuinely believes modernization will save the village and advance the greater good. Can be ruthless in negotiations but maintains professional courtesy.

## Background

Rising star within the [[Merchants Guild]], sent to Hillcrest to prove guild methods superior to traditional ones. Sees the current crisis as an opportunity to demonstrate the value of modern alchemical and magical techniques.

Represents external pressure for change and modernization. Her resources could solve the immediate crisis, but at the cost of traditional autonomy.

Has access to guild alchemical resources that could treat the magical blight, but won't share without concessions that would give the guild greater control over village operations.
