## Physical Description

Slender and enigmatic with long, flowing black hair streaked with premature silver. Pale blue eyes seem to see beyond the physical world, and she often appears to be listening to sounds others cannot hear.

## Notes

### Current Situation
Hilda is deeply concerned about recent developments:
- **Forest Corruption:** The supernatural taint is spreading faster than she anticipated
- **Mayor's Behavior:** Her divination magic detects warlock magic around Mayor Stoneheart
- **Increasing Threats:** Creatures from the forest are becoming more aggressive and organized
- **Isolation Effect:** The sealed gates prevent her from consulting with other magical practitioners

- **Forest History:** Has researched the ancient fey entities that once ruled Blackwood
- **Hidden Wards:** Has placed protective enchantments around the town that the Mayor doesn't know about

### Current Magical Research
1. **Forest Corruption Patterns:** Mapping the spread of supernatural influence
2. **Fey Entity Identification:** Trying to determine which ancient power is awakening
3. **Warlock Magic Detection:** Studying the specific type of pact magic affecting the Mayor
4. **Protective Ward Enhancement:** Developing stronger defenses for the town

### Plot Hooks & Opportunities
1. **Magical Knowledge:** Essential for understanding the forest's supernatural corruption
2. **Investigation Partner:** Could ally with party to investigate Mayor's secrets
3. **Magical Services:** Provides spells and items not available elsewhere in the region
4. **Supernatural Network:** Can provide information about threats throughout the frontier

- **Others:** Evaluates everyone for their magical potential and supernatural connections

### "I Know a Guy" Potential
- **Randi:** Fellow wizard connections through magical academic networks
