## Physical Description

Lean and weathered from years in the wilderness, with short brown hair that's prematurely streaked with gray. A rugged beard frames his angular face, and his keen green eyes constantly scan his surroundings. Wears practical leather armor over forest-colored clothing, with a longbow always at hand. Multiple small scars on his hands and arms tell stories of close encounters with dangerous wildlife.

**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Ranger (Beast Master)  
**Age:** 38

### Animal Companion
**Shadowpaw** - A large black wolf with unusual intelligence, bonded to Elias for eight years. The wolf has an uncanny ability to sense supernatural threats and often serves as an early warning system for the town.

## Personality

- **Calm:** Rarely loses his composure, even in dangerous situations

- **Personal:** Uncover the truth behind Mayor Stoneheart's recent strange behavior
- **Long-term:** Establish a ranger network throughout Crestfall's frontier

## Background

Born and raised in Stonehaven, Elias has spent over two decades patrolling Blackwood Forest. He's witnessed the forest's gradual darkening over recent years - more aggressive creatures, unnatural weather patterns, and areas where even he fears to tread. He was instrumental in training the current generation of town guards and maintains extensive maps of safe routes through the forest.

**Title:** Master Ranger of Stonehaven

- **Julie (Archaeologist):** Fascinated by her knowledge of ancient sites; has discovered old ruins in the forest that might interest her
