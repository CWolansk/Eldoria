Broad-shouldered and imposing, neatly trimmed beard, sharp blue eyes that miss nothing. Wears practical guard armor maintained in excellent condition.

## Personality

Duty-bound and observant, caught between protecting the village and investigating potential sabotage. Maintains professional demeanor while under pressure from competing political factions.

## Background

Experienced guard captain who coordinates with the [[Highreach]] garrison while maintaining village security. Answers to [[Mayor Linden Hearthwood]] but faces pressure from the [[Merchants Guild]] and other external forces.

Leader of the Village Guard (Neutral faction).

Has evidence suggesting the vineyard blight is artificially created but lacks resources to investigate properly. His security knowledge could be crucial to uncovering sabotage or external threats.

## Notes

Law enforcement contact who can provide security support and investigation assistance. His evidence about the artificial nature of the blight could be a key plot hook.

- **Professional Pressure**: [[Eliza Brightwine]] and [[Merchants Guild]] - Seek to influence security priorities
