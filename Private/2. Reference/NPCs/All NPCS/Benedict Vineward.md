## Physical Description

Tall and sturdy, sun-kissed skin from decades in vineyards, short curly brown hair, calloused hands that are surprisingly gentle with plants. Wears traditional vintner clothing with practical modifications.

## Personality

Stubborn traditionalist with deep plant wisdom, fears losing ancestral knowledge to modernization. Genuinely cares about preserving the methods that have sustained the village for centuries.

## Background

Childhood friend of [[Mayor Linden Hearthwood]], representing the old families who have worked these vineyards for generations. Mentors younger vintners in traditional methods and serves as keeper of ancestral wine-making secrets.

Leader of the Traditional Vintners Coalition.

Knows the location of an ancient druidic shrine that might hold the cure for the current blight, but fears that using magical "contamination" would compromise traditional methods.

## Notes

Guardian of old knowledge and traditional methods. His cooperation is essential for any solution that preserves village culture, and his druidic shrine knowledge could be crucial.

### Attitude toward Party Members
- **[[JP Player Sheet]]**: Suspicious initially due to racial prejudice but respects honest labor and physical strength
- **[[Julie]]**: Values her interest in preserving old knowledge and archaeological expertise
- **[[Private Claire notes]]**: Uncomfortable with divine magic but desperate enough to accept help if properly approached

**TODO**: Detail the druidic shrine location, traditional wine-making secrets, and mentorship relationships

- **Philosophical Opponent**: [[Eliza Brightwine]] - Represents everything he fears about change
- **Mentor Role**: Younger traditional vintners look to him for guidance
