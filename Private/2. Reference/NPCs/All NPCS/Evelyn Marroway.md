## Physical Description

Evelyn is of average height, with a trim figure and an impeccable sense of style. She has ash-blonde hair styled in a smooth, practical bun, with a few strands artfully framing her face. Her keen, hazel eyes are framed by fine lines that hint at her years of experience in the guild. Evelyn wears well-tailored, modest attire in deep greens and grays, accented with a single silver brooch that bears the guild's emblem.

## Personality

Evelyn is known for her professionalism and calm demeanor. She has an uncanny memory for names, faces, and details of past dealings, making her invaluable to both the Guildmaster and visiting merchants. She speaks in a soft, measured tone, and when listening, she nods thoughtfully, giving her full attention to whoever is speaking. Evelyn keeps meticulous notes in a leather-bound ledger and has a habit of adjusting her quill with precision after each entry.
