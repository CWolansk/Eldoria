## Physical Description

Alistair is a wiry man in his early 50s, with graying hair slicked back meticulously and sharp, calculating blue eyes that seem to miss nothing. He wears finely tailored clothes in muted colors, preferring practicality over ostentation.<br>Alistair has a habit of tapping his fingers rhythmically on any surface when he’s thinking. He often adjusts his collar and cuffs, a sign of his anxiety when discussing anything that could tarnish his reputation. Alistair maintains a formal tone and rarely makes eye contact, preferring to appear detached and in control.
