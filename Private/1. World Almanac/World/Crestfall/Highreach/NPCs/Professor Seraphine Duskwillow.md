## Physical Description

Seraphine is a mysterious and pale human woman with long black hair that seems to absorb light. She dresses in dark, elegant robes trimmed with silver, and her eyes have a piercing, almost otherworldly quality. Though her specialty often inspires fear, she is a compassionate and misunderstood figure, teaching her students to respect life and death while exploring the ethical use of necromantic magic. Her soft-spoken nature hides a fierce intellect and a deep well of empathy for those who seek to understand the mysteries of life and death.
