## Physical Description

The barkeep is a towering, barrel-chested man with thick, muscular arms and a round face, perpetually rosy from years of tasting his own brews. His dark, bushy beard and lively, twinkling eyes give him a jovial, almost Santa-like appearance, and he’s quick to flash a wide grin at anyone who walks through the door.
