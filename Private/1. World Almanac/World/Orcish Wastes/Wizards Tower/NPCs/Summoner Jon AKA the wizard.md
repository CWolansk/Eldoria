## Physical Description

Appears as a kindly bald old man in red and gold robes, but the illusion hides a lich: grey, cracked skin stretched over a skeletal frame with tattered robes. The last surviving wizard of the ancient Wizarding Wars, he has endured for centuries.

## Personality

## Background

## Notes

True name **Jon the Unbroken**. Believes that might makes right and seeks to conquer the world to prove his strength. Currently trapped within his tower and unable to unleash his full power, he manipulates nearby orc tribes and summons demons to act for him. To break his confinement, he hunts for scattered artifacts, starting with the [[Seekers Eye]] to locate the rest.
