## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### Racial Dynamics with JP
- **Initial Reaction**: Many NPCs will show prejudice against JP initially
- **Earning Respect**: Provide clear paths for JP to prove himself through actions
- **Variety**: Some NPCs are surprisingly accepting, others irredeemably biased
- **Consequences**: NPC attitudes should change based on JP's (and party's) actions

### High-Magic Integration
- Magic is commonplace, not feared or mysterious
- Many NPCs have minor magical abilities or items
- Magical solutions to mundane problems are normal
- Focus on magical convenience vs. magical power

### Guild System
- Most professionals belong to relevant guilds
- Guild membership affects pricing, access, and social status
- Inter-guild politics and rivalries
- Guild obligations and benefits

### "I Know a Guy" Potential
- Consider how this NPC could serve as a future connection
- What unique resources or knowledge they provide
- How party members might remember meeting them
