## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### Multiple Approaches
Every encounter should offer at least 3 different approaches:
- **Combat**: Direct confrontation option
- **Social**: Diplomatic or deception solution
- **Skill-Based**: Environmental or puzzle-solving approach
- **Creative**: Unconventional party solutions

### Racial Dynamics
- Consider JP's experience with prejudice
- Show opportunities for him to earn respect
- Some NPCs may be initially hostile, others surprisingly accepting
- Reflect realistic social tensions without being preachy

### Guild Integration
- Adventurers Guild: Reputation, resources, obligations
- Merchants Guild: Justin's connections, trade opportunities, monthly dues

### Consequence-Driven
- Every significant action has meaningful ripple effects
- Political implications across kingdoms
- Effects on artifact quest progression
- Social relationship changes

## PROMPT VARIABLES

- **Encounter Type**: combat/social/exploration/puzzle/mixed
- **Party Level**: Current character levels
