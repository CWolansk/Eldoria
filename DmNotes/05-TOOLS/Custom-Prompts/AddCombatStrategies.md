Search the {activeNote} for DND Monsters and come up with strategies that they would realistically employ during the fight. For example, a pack of wolves would most likely attempt to surround and flank the party and attempt to pick off the weakest or sickest looking adventurers. 
The result should be a formatted list of monsters with suggestions for how they would work together or work against each other if you determine that their goals wouldn't align.
