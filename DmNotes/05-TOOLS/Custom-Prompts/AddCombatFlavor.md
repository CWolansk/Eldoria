At the bottom of the {activeNote} add combat flavor text. This flavor text should incorporate information from the {activeNote} as well as other notes that are tagged in the {activeNote} or are relevant based on the content of the {activeNote}. 
Combat flavor text should be a list of descriptions that can be added as quick sayings when a monster attacks a PC. For example, "The goblins eyes glint with rage as he stabs toward you with his spear" or "The gelatinous cube seems to ooze forward, in an attempt to envelop you"
Similarly, we should incorporate the environment for attacking the players, incorporate smells, feelings, and other senses in small or longer blurbs depending on the type of combat. The amount of flavor text provided can vary depending on how many monsters there are, if there are more monsters there should be more flavor text. 
Finally, if needed ask for clarifying questions about the players, the monsters, or the environment.
