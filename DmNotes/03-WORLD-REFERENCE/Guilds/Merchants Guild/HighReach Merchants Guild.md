Exterior Description

The Merchants Guild Headquarters is a modest-sized, two-story stone building situated on a quiet street in the Merchant District. Its facade is finely crafted with clean lines and quality stonework, accented by dark wooden trim around the windows and a sturdy oak door with polished brass handles. A small plaque beside the door bears the guild's emblem: a pair of scales overlaid with crossed keys, symbolizing both commerce and security. Large windows on the ground floor allow natural light to filter in, but curtains are often drawn to maintain privacy for sensitive dealings. The building’s understated elegance reflects the guild’s financial strength, standing apart from other shops while blending seamlessly into the street’s architecture.

Interior Description

The interior of the guild is tasteful and meticulously organized. The entry hall is warmly lit by sconces along the walls and furnished with plush chairs and a well-crafted oak counter where a receptionist greets visitors. The walls are adorned with fine paintings of past guildmasters and notable guild members, each frame polished to a high shine. The main meeting room features a long, polished table surrounded by comfortable leather chairs, with discreet shelves along the walls holding ledgers, maps, and scrolls that document trade routes, merchant agreements, and guild charters.

Alongside the main room is a small lounge where members can discuss business over tea or brandy. The floors are carpeted in rich, dark hues that mute the sounds of footsteps, and intricate tapestries hang in various corners, depicting scenes of prosperous markets and distant lands. Despite its size, the guild maintains an air of quiet authority and refined taste, with each detail carefully curated to convey professionalism and power without ostentation.
