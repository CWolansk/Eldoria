## Overview
The Foundation is a secretive society of protectors dedicated to safeguarding the common people who form the bedrock of civilization. Operating across kingdom lines, they believe that true strength comes from solid foundations - protecting those who cannot protect themselves.

## Philosophy

- **Mission**: Protect civilians and maintain social stability from the shadows
- **Values**: Humility, service, and quiet heroism without recognition

## Insignia & Recognition

- **Badge**: Small plain rock pendant that appears to be just a simple stone to outsiders

## Secret Catchphrases
- **Primary**: "What do the common people smell?" 
- **Response**: "Only what the rock is cooking."
- **Alternative Exchanges**:
