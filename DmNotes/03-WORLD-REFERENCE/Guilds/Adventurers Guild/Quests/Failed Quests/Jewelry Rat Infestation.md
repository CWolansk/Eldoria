[[Highreach Duplirat Invasion]] 
[[Beatrix Goldleaf]] is desperate to have all of her gems returned and all of those nasty rats killed and disposed of. If these brave adventurers and kill all of those rats and collect all of her jewelry a handsome tip will be waiting for them

- **Description**: The party is hired by a wealthy jeweler whose basement is infested with rats that have chewed through several storage chests. The rats have not only destroyed packaging materials but have also scattered small jewels and valuables around the basement, creating a chaotic mess and even stealing some pieces into their nests.
- **Objective**: Clear out the rats, recover any scattered or stolen jewelry, and locate the ratsâ€™ nest to find any missing valuables. Some of the rats have been seen gnawing on a few gold and silver pieces, adding insult to injury.
- **Hazard**: Some jewels may be hidden in tight crevices or rat nests, requiring players to search thoroughly.

Some of the gems will already have been gone but if they stop any more from getting taken then they get their tip. 

For this one the map can be kind of maze like with one exit to the sewers near the stairs. The party will need to guard the exit and chase the rats around the room or just straight up shoot the rats and recover the gems. 

On the way out, she says if they find any gems that they think might be hers then if they bring them back she'll gladly reward everyone for it. They'll be able to tell because she has had her family insignia etched into each of her gems, a golden leaf.
