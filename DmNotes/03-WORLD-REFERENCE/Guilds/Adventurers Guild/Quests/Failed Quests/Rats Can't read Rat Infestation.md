Jon answers the door and groans when he sees the party. 
If the party can kill all of the rats and save as many books as possible he will gift them a magic scroll as a tip 
There are some magical rats in this batch that the party needs to kill while attempting to stop the rats from destroying the books 

- **Description**: An aristocratic scholarâ€™s basement is home to an impressive collection of old tomes, rare scrolls, and valuable research notes. Recently, rats have begun nibbling on the parchment, leaving valuable documents tattered and defaced. The scholar is particularly distressed because some of the damaged tomes are magical texts that are difficult to replace.
- **Objective**: Clear out the rats and rescue as many scrolls and books as possible. Some of the rats may even have absorbed minor magical energy from gnawing on enchanted tomes, causing a few of them to display strange abilities.
- **Hazard**: Players need to handle certain enchanted texts carefully, as disturbing them could cause magical effects (e.g., a scroll releasing a harmless but startling flash of light).
