#ELevelQuest #HighReach #Quest 
The merchants guild needs a group of adventurers to protect a [[Brom Goldfang]] until they get past the Highreach mines to protect them from goblins and from bandits. 
- this is a false narrative, as soon as the merchants guild finds out that the group that will be escorting Brom is the party the assasins will be sent out after them.
