Sewer description

As you enter the sewer you're standing on a narrow walkway on the side of the sewer system, the wall to your left is covered in grime and ancient graffiti, most of it unintellgible. To your right you can see a steady stream of sewer water and sewer gas clouds your vision making it hard to see in the distance. Making it seem like the sewer tunnels go on forever ^f56821


- Vision is impacted by sewer gas, everything in the sewers is hazy and you can only see until about 30 ft in front of you unless you have truesight or similar



 1. The party sees a dark figure in the distance, its form wavering and dripping with a thick, viscous black ooze. As they approach, the figure shifts, transforming into a grinning, gaunt figure with hollow, pitch-black eyes. It raises a finger to its lips, beckoning them forward. When they get close enough, the form dissolves into a puddle of slime, and a voice whispers from the shadows, "Raatma sees you now." A trail of black slime leads further into the sewers, inviting them to follow. ^46b696
	* In the puddle of slime, two eyes and a wide grin appear, its wide grin stretching impossibly far as it whispers to each party member, calling them by name. The reflections on the water twist, showing visions of each character covered in grime. When they try to step back, their reflections stay locked on the water, staring at them, grinning with Raatma’s eyes until they break the connection or look away.
		- Everyone that looks into the water needs to attempt a dc 15 charisma saving throw. On failure when fighting Raatma the people that failed this saving throw will be automatically charmed by the raatmas presence ability
2. Party sees a humanoid in the distance, as they get closer the humanoid gets down on all fours and runs away ^7a2bd7
3. In the distance you can see a human peak their head around a corner, when the party goes to investigate the human is gone. ^850b75
4. Graffiti on the wall that says "Raatma" ^409742
5. The party should encounter humans covered in black grime within the sewer. The human covered in grim is in a fetal position rocking back and forth. ^a174ff
	1. If they try to interrogate any of these people they will only respond in grunts, if they press the homeless people will respond with "Raatma has shown me the light, God has come for highreach"
6. The party sees a small child standing ankle-deep in sewage, staring at the wall with a vacant expression. As they approach, the child slowly turns around, revealing completely blackened eyes. The child whispers, "Raatma knows you’re here," before quickly vanishing around a corner, leaving faint, muddy footprints that slowly fade away. ^b02a29
7. Dim torchlight reveals a crowd of figures huddled together, muttering unintelligibly. As the party gets closer, the group disperses like rats, each figure scurrying away into dark alcoves. When the party searches the area, they find symbols scratched into the walls and bits of dried, darkened sludge. The symbols are rough drawings of eyes, mouths, and something that resembles a grinning, toothy maw. ^410d8b

Raatma Encounter

- When the party gets closer to the center of the sewers, in the distance they will hear chanting.
- Following the chanting there is a large area with a large group of grimey people are standing around the edges chanting Raatma

- When the party enters the room a large door slams shut behind them and the chanting stops
- In the center of the room a large group of rats swarm and start stacking on top of each other  forming a humanoid shape made of rats

- From the stack of rats Raatma is at the center. Refer to raatma description and start combat with raatma going first and doing raatmas presense

- If the party tries to exit the sewers they will find the entrance of the sewers blocked with a large boulder

- The raatma and the rat troll will engage the party near the boulder entrance
- 'In the distance behind you, you can hear the pitter patter and scratching of a large amount of rats scurrying towards you' although you can't see anything on the ground

- Raatma emerges from the darkness surrounded by hordes of rats (refer to raatma description) and start combat with raatma going first and doing raatmas presense
