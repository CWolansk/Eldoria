#ELevelQuest #Ardenville #Quest

A skiff of young netters vanished near the mist line at dusk. Captain [[Gregor Woods]] seeks seven Level 5 E‑ranked trackers to find the crew and learn what dragged them from the lake.

**Briefing:** Gregor meets the party at the guard barracks with the netters’ route and last known heading.

**Investigation**
- Survival DC 13 to follow drifting net markers.
- Optional: chat with [[Mira Softstep]] for rumors about strange lights over the water.

**Encounter:** The skiff lies snagged on a half‑submerged ruin guarded by three grindylows and a giant eel (use *Giant Constrictor Snake* statistics).

**Objectives**
- Rescue at least two of the three missing netters.
- Defeat or drive off the monsters.

**Aftermath:** Return survivors to Gregor and report any clues about why the creatures struck.

**Reward:** 50 gp per rescued fisher and a 25 gp bonus for identifying the attackers.
