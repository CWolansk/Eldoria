#ELevelQuest #HighReach #Quest 

The party needs to clear out a small bandit camp that is harrassing travellers on the main trade route between Highreach and Arden 

Sexy Wizard Gang has set up an outpost off the main road between Highreach and Ardenville. The guild is offering 50 gold for the adventuring party that can go and bring the bandits in to be tried.  

Sexy wizard gang is ran by pitbull who is a wizard that only knows fireball but kind of sucks at it. 

The bandit group is off the main road in a small abandoned cottage.
The front of the cottage is guarded by two bandits and their trained owlbears, with another bandit patrolling around the back that will come running if they hear anything. 

Inside the cottage the sexy wizard Pete Bull is planning their next heist, of a wealthy merchant [[Brom Goldfang]] 

Pete Bull is a bald but jacked wizard wearing a V shaped vest and flowy garments. 
Pete Bull isn't actually a wizard he just fakes it with many magical fire scrolls
