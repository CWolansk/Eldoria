#ELevelQuest #Ardenville #Quest

The storm-racked warehouse on the outer pier leans dangerously after last season's squall. Mayor [[Isolde Fairweather]] seeks seven Level 5 E-rank adventurers to ensure the structure is empty and mark unstable beams before the town tears it down.

**Briefing:** Meet Isolde at the Netted Nymph to receive chalk tags and a list of any remaining valuables.

**Objectives**
- Drive off or slay two swarms of rats (use *Swarm of Rats* statistics) and one ochre jelly.
- Mark five unstable support beams with bright chalk.

**Complications**
- Falling debris requires a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
- Rotten floorboards demand a DC 13 Perception check to spot before stepping through.

**Aftermath:** Return your report and any recovered items to Isolde; she promises to lobby for reduced docking fees on the party's impounded ship.

**Reward:** 80 gp and reduced docking fees for one vessel.
