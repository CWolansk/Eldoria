With the boat race nearing, unknown hands are slicing contenders' rigging at night. Mayor [[Isolde Fairweather]] asks for seven Level 5 E‑ranked investigators to catch the saboteur before the starting horn.

**Briefing:** Meet Isolde in the Netted Nymph common room to receive a list of targeted crews and their dock assignments.

**Investigation**
- Examine cut sails (Intelligence DC 12) to note a hooked blade.
- Question dockhands (Charisma DC 13) to learn of a hooded figure near the Merchants Guild warehouses.
- Stake out the docks past midnight.

**Encounter:** Two thugs and a scout hired by rival merchant Marla Vex attempt to slash another sail and flee.

**Objectives**
- Capture at least one saboteur alive for questioning.
- Trace the plot back to Marla Vex.

**Aftermath:** Report findings to Isolde, who uses the evidence to pressure the Merchants Guild.

**Reward:** 100 gp and public favor during the race.
