#ELevelQuest #Ardenville #Quest

Edda Netsong seeks seven Level 5 E‑ranked adventurers to hack back the kelp beds choking the shallows and drive out the slime eels nesting there so the fishers can cast safely again.

**Briefing:** Meet Edda at the fishers' pier to receive kelp hooks and tide charts.

**Objectives**
- Clear three 30‑foot patches of kelp without damaging pier pilings.
- Defeat three swarms of slime eels (use *Swarm of Poisonous Snakes* statistics).

**Complications**
- Thick fronds require a DC 12 Athletics check or slashing damage to cut.
- Hidden sinkholes demand a DC 14 Perception check to avoid.

**Aftermath:** Report back to Edda; Harbormaster [[Kellen Redshore]] inspects the cleared lanes before payment.

**Reward:** 75 gp and a favor from the Fisherman’s Guild.
