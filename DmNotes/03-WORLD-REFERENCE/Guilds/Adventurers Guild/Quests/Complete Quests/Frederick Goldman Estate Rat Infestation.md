[[Lord Frederick Goldman]]


	- Rat Fight ^ef43ba
	- 3 doppelrats

After the battle if the party gets the rat tails

- The rats do not disappear but they are perfect clones
- Whoever wants to collect the rat tails should make either a survival or nature check

- Nat 20 => 30 rat tails
- Otherwise the dice roll is the number of rat tails collected

Depending on how long the battle takes and what spells the party uses to attack the rats

- If the party hits any of the shelves of wines those bottles are destroyed

The party can attempt to steal some wine

- Perception check to find a fancy wine

- 200 gp wine for nat 20
- 100 gp wine for 18+
- 50 gp wine for 14+
- 20 gp wine for 10+
- 5 gp wine otherwise
- Vinegar for nat 1

- If the party decides to look for where the rats got in they might be able to find a sewer grate on the far side of the room for any water to run down. If they look into the sewer grate they will see a substantial amount of rats looking back at them and then scurry away.
- If the party wants to know anything about the magic of doppelrats they can find traces of transmutation magic

When the party emerges from the basement the bulter will be waiting for them to ask how it went and to see if they died.

- If they are taking too long in the basement the butler will come down to check on them
- He will tell them to go back to the guild if they want to get paid and will usher them out the back door
