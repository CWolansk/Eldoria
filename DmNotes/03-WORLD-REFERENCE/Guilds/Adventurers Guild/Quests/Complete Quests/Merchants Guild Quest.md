[[Party Ambushed by Merchant Guild Bandits]] 

Alistair Goldman needs a group of adventurers for a private matter. 
After the receptionist greets the group she sends them to the guildmasters office which is a dimly lit office with a large oak desk, sconces lighting up the room and with a large plush carpet covering the entire floor. 

He explains that there has been some gang activity recently threatening some of the smaller merchants around town and demanding they pay a protection fee. They have come to the Guild master for help and he has been able to find out where the gangs waits for the merchants to drop off the money. He wants the adventurers to go there instead of the merchants and "talk" to the gang members. 

Confronting the "Gang"
Following the guildmasters directions will easily let the party get to the abandonded shack in the poor area of town. 
It doesn't look like guards patrol here very often 
The Shack looks abandoned and not upkept with several broken windows and missing roof tiles. 
* The shack is one room with several windows on each side. There is a weed infested field behind the shack and a badly maintained cobblestone road leading up to it
Inside the shack a 5 men are sitting around a table playing cards 

The leader is [[Jarek IronFist]] and he is surrounded by 4 other men wearing black cloaks and with various swords surrounding them 

Jarek sees the party come in the front door and says for them to leave the money near the door and if its not all there he'll come and find them. 

Battle 
* Jarek has the bandit Captain Statblock and the 4 other cronies are level 3 human mercenaries
