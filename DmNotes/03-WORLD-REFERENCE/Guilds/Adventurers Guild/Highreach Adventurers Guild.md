Exterior
The entrance is guarded by two formidable statues of armored warriors, each holding a gleaming sword pointed towards the sky. The large wooden doors, reinforced with iron bands, are intricately carved with the crest of Crestfall – a shield emblazoned with a roaring lion and crossed swords. Above the entrance, a grand archway features a stained glass window depicting the kingdom’s most revered heroes.

Interior
As you step inside, you are greeted by a vast, open hall with high vaulted ceilings supported by massive stone columns. The floor is made of polished marble, reflecting the light from chandeliers that hang majestically above, each adorned with crystals that cast a dazzling array of colors across the room.

Reception Area
To your left, a reception area is managed by a well-dressed attendant who greets you warmly. Behind them, a large notice board is covered with various announcements, quest postings, and messages from the guild members. The scent of fresh parchment and ink fills the air, mingling with the faint aroma of polished wood and stone.

Main Hall
In the center of the main hall, a grand staircase splits into two, leading to the upper floors. On either side of the staircase, tall windows allow natural light to flood the space, illuminating the rich tapestries that hang on the walls.

Church 
Non denominational church ran by [[Father Eldon Lightbringer]] 
rows of unadorned pews face a plain altar lit by warm lanterns. The soft glow highlights walls carefully inscribed with broad, inclusive maxims—gentle reminders of courage, compassion, and fellowship. Just off to the side, a small door leads to a cozy healing chamber where priests administer restorations to the weary and wounded, offering salves, bandages, and a moment of solace before the next great adventure. ^c5c9ce
