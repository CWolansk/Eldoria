## Overview
Founded three generations ago by gnome refugees from the Orcish Wastes, what began as desperate pest control has evolved into something far more sophisticated. The Exterminators Guild serves as the legitimate front for the most powerful gnome crime family in Highreach. Under [[Don Gnocianno]]'s flamboyant leadership—he is both guildmaster and actual *Don* of the gnome mafia—the organization maintains perfect cover through genuine pest control services while running extensive money laundering, smuggling, and protection operations through Highreach's underground tunnel network.

The recent "inclusivity" policy isn't progressive ideology—it's calculated criminal strategy. Don Gnocianno specifically recruited the heroic party to provide legitimacy, muscle, and access to circles previously beyond gnome mafia reach. Their induction serves dual purposes: the party's reputation shields the guild from scrutiny while their diverse capabilities open new criminal opportunities.

## Leadership Hierarchy

### **Don/Guildmaster**: [[Don Gnocianno]]
The real deal—an actual mafia Don who uses flamboyant persona and pest control business as perfect cover. Meticulously waxed rat-tail beard and pinstripe vest aren't just fashion choices; they're calculated intimidation wrapped in eccentricity. Seeks royal recognition to protect criminal operations while expanding territory through "legitimate" means.

### **Underboss/Master Exterminator**: [[Pip Whiskerwind]]
Don's predecessor's daughter, fully aware of family business but prefers focusing on legitimate operations. Traditional values include both pest control expertise *and* old-school criminal codes. Views party recruitment as dangerous exposure but trusts Don's strategic thinking. Handles the guild's most sensitive "pest problems."

### **Consigliere/Chief Scout**: [[Nimble Nackfinger]]
The Don's most trusted advisor and tunnel network mastermind. Coordinates legitimate city guard relationships while managing smuggling routes and safe houses. Professional respect for Justin's merchant connections represents opportunity for new criminal partnerships and money laundering channels.

### **Enforcer/Quartermaster**: [[Squeak Tinkerbottom]]
Young but ambitious, handles both equipment and "enforcement" duties. Magical innovations serve dual purposes—enhanced headdresses for guild members, specialized tools for breaking and entering. Fascination with Claire's storm powers includes criminal applications: destroying evidence, creating diversions, accessing restricted areas.

## Operations & Services

### Standard Contracts (Legitimate Front)
- **Rat Extermination**: 5-15 gp per building *(inflated prices launder criminal profits)*

- **Tunnel Mapping**: Detailed sewer charts for 10 gp per district *(intelligence for criminal planning)*

## Internal Politics

### **Current Tension**: Old School vs. New Opportunities
**Old School** (led by Pip Whiskerwind): Prefer traditional criminal methods—stay small, stay hidden, maintain perfect cover. Worry that recruiting "outsiders" exposes family secrets and threatens generations of careful operational security.

**New Opportunities** (led by Don Gnocianno): Argue that heroic reputation and diverse capabilities open previously impossible criminal ventures. Royal favor provides ultimate protection for expanding territory and operations beyond traditional gnome crime limitations.

### **Growth Opportunity**: Royal Pest Control Contract (The Ultimate Score)
King's interest in guild inclusivity creates unprecedented opportunity—exclusive palace maintenance contract worth 500+ gold monthly provides perfect cover for accessing royal treasures, state secrets, and political intelligence. Success requires proving "reformed" adventurers can handle sensitive work.

### **External Pressure**: Merchant Guild Competition (Turf War)
Merchant guild members establishing competing pest control services threatens both legitimate cover and criminal territory. Some merchants suspect guild's true nature, creating dangerous exposure risk. Don Gnocianno must eliminate competition without revealing criminal operations.

## Headquarters: The Warren

### Layout
Located 30 feet beneath Highreach's Noble District, accessed through hidden grate near the Royal Gardens. The perfect location for monitoring wealthy targets while maintaining legitimate business cover. Main chamber features:
- **Central Meeting Hall**: Rat banners conceal family crests; oversized cheese wheel table has hidden compartments for weapons and contraband; furniture accommodates both meetings and "family business"
- **Equipment Storage**: Legitimate pest control supplies mixed with criminal tools, forged documents, and laundered money counting area
- **Pip's Laboratory**: Potion brewing doubles as poison creation; headdress enchantment workshop includes lockpick enhancement and surveillance equipment
- **Tunnel Command**: Detailed maps serve both pest control and smuggling route coordination; emergency protocols include evidence destruction procedures

### Atmosphere
Permanent aroma of cheese and soap masks chemical scents from poison brewing and money bleaching operations. Magical rat-oil lamps provide normal lighting but can dim to near-darkness for clandestine meetings. Training rat squeaking covers conversations from potential eavesdropping. Immaculate cleanliness serves both professional pride and evidence elimination.

### Notable Features
- **The Hall of Tails**: Wall display includes trophies from eliminated "rats" (criminal targets and snitches)
- **Communication Tubes**: Speaking tubes connect to legitimate entrances *and* hidden criminal safe houses throughout the city

## Plot Hooks

### **Immediate Opportunity**: Package Delivery to Ardenville (The Test)
Don Gnocianno needs a "special pest control shipment" delivered to their Ardenville contact—a simple courier job paying 50 gp for what should be routine travel. The package is suspiciously heavy, carefully sealed, and comes with strict instructions: deliver only to "Ratcatcher" Finn at the Salty Sailor tavern, don't open it, and mention it's "for controlling the big rats." 

The party's heroic reputation provides perfect cover for transporting what's actually laundered money and criminal correspondence without arousing suspicion from road patrols or port authorities. Don Gnocianno presents this as helping expand legitimate pest control services, but careful observation might reveal inconsistencies in the story. Success establishes trust for more questionable future "deliveries."

### **Medium-Term Storyline**: The Turf War (Criminal Competition)
Competing merchants discovering guild's true nature forces escalating conflict. Party must choose sides as evidence mounts of guild's criminal activities. Don Gnocianno needs party's heroic reputation to eliminate threats while maintaining plausible deniability. Moral complexity as party realizes their complicity.

### **Long-Term Campaign Integration**: The Criminal Network (Dangerous Alliance)
Guild's extensive criminal connections could provide crucial intelligence for tracking artifacts—but at what cost? Demon cult activities might intersect with gnome mafia territory, forcing uncomfortable alliances. Party must decide whether to expose guild, become complicit, or find third option that preserves relationships while maintaining moral standing.

## Connections

### **Key NPCs**
- **Captain [[Brix Ironwhistle]]** (City Guard): Unknowingly compromised through guild "cooperation"; believes guild intelligence legitimate while actually facilitating criminal operations

## Current Campaign Status
Following the party's heroic actions during the Highreach rat infestation, they've been formally inducted as unwitting assets in the gnome mafia's expansion plans. The rat-themed headdresses serve dual purposes: symbols of their "honored" status and subtle marking for other criminal organizations that these adventurers are under Don Gnocianno's protection.

The party's reputation provides perfect legitimacy cover while their diverse capabilities open criminal opportunities previously impossible for gnome-only operations. Don Gnocianno plays the long game—gradually involving them in increasingly questionable "pest control" jobs while maintaining plausible deniability. Whether the party realizes the truth and how they respond will determine their relationship with Highreach's most sophisticated criminal organization.

**DM Note**: The guild can function as legitimate ally, moral challenge, or eventual antagonist depending on party choices and how much they discover about the true operations.
