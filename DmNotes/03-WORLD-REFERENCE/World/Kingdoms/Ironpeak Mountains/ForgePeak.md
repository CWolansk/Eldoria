Dwarven Kingdoms crest is a Pickaxe a hammer and a shovel all gold and crossed on a red background

Capitol of the ironpeak mountains. Forgepeak, nestled deep within the heart of Ironpeak Mountain, was founded by the legendary dwarven clan known as the Stonefists. Master craftsmen and miners, the Stonefists were drawn to Ironpeak's rich veins of precious metals and gems, seeing the mountain's depths as a gift from their patron deity, Moradin. They carved the city from the living rock, shaping halls, tunnels, and grand chambers that echoed with the clang of hammers and the roar of molten metal.
