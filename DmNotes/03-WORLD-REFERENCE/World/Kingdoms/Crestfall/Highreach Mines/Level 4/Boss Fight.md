[[Room 13 Level 3]] 
# [[High Reach Mines Boss Fight]] - Level 4 Encounter

## Part 1: The Descent and the Barrier

> As you venture deeper through the melted entrance, the oppressive droning in your ears intensifies, reaching a feverish pitch. The red mist, a constant companion on the previous level, thickens with each step downward, obscuring your vision. The ground is uneven, and you stumble over unseen rocks.
>
> Finally, the narrow, melted tunnel opens into a larger chamber. Abruptly, the skull-drilling drone ceases, replaced by an unnerving silence. Dominating the center of this new room is an opaque, shimmering blue barrier. The pervasive red mist mysteriously halts several feet away from it. On the floor in front of the barrier, you can see a raised block of marble with with strange but familiar writing carved into it.

### The Inscription

> As you approach, you can make out the inscription. It's penned in a familiar script, though the language itself might be foreign to some.
>
> *In Spanish:*
> *Para vencer la maldición protectora, basta con citar un versículo de la Biblia.*
> *- Diego*
>
> *Translated (Common):*
> *To overcome the protective curse, simply quote a bible verse.*

**DM Note:** *If players don't speak Spanish, allow an Intelligence (Religion) or Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 13) to decipher the meaning or recall relevant lore about such protective wards.*

## Part 2: The Orb and the Deception

### Barrier Dispelled

> Upon speaking a suitable verse, the blue barrier shimmers violently and then vanishes, pushing the red mist out of the room with a silent rush.
>
> In the middle of the now clear room, a stone pedestal stands, upon which rests a small, pulsating, light blue orb – the [[Seekers Eye]].

### The Wizard's Gambit

> As soon as anyone touch the orb and makes a move towards the exit, a transparent figure appears at the entrance in a swirl of arcane energy – it's the [[Summoner Jon AKA the wizard]] .
>
> **Wizard:** "Excellent, my friends! With the barrier dispelled I am able to appear before you here. Quickly, (A shimmering black portal appears next to him) toss the [[Seekers Eye]] into my portal, and we can begin the process of sending you all home!"

## Part 3: The Confrontation

### Decision Point: The Eye

*   **If the party refuses to give the orb:**
    > **Wizard:** (His friendly mask drops instantly, revealing cold malice) "How... disappointing. I had hoped you'd be more cooperative, but I suppose I'll have to take it from your corpses instead."
    > 
    > *He gestures with dark energy, and the orb is yanked from your grasp by invisible force, flying directly into his outstretched hand.*
    > **Make a DC 19 Reflex save** -> Failure continue below, is success the party keeps the orb and the wizard immediately drops his facade 
    > 
    > **Wizard:**  "This power was never meant for sending you home, fools. It will serve a far grander purpose." (He Crushes the orb, as dark energy swirls around him and is absorbed)
    > 
    > *The wizard vanishes in a swirl of shadow and malice as his laughter echoes around you . 
    > *Proceed to **The Transformation and Combat**.*


*   **If the party is able to hold onto the orb:**
    > The Wizards illusory magic drops and the players can see his true face as he screams with rage and agony. The healthy pink skin melts away and you can see underneath dry, cracked greyish skin, pulled tightly against his bones. Giving him an almost skeletal look. His red and gold robes fade and rip, looking almost ancient.
    > **Wizard** : You fools, before this I might have let you live. 
    > **He gestures again, dark energy pools around his hands and the lights in the chamber dim before all light around you flickers out completely** 
    > *Proceed to **The Transformation and Combat**.*


*   **If the party gives the orb:**
    > **Wizard:** (Catching the orb with a triumphant grin) "Excellent! You've made this so much easier." 
    > 
    > *As the orb touches his hands, his facade begins to crack. His eyes glow with malevolent energy, and his voice becomes cold and mocking.*
    > 
    > **Wizard:** "Did you truly believe I cared about your pathetic little lives? About sending you 'home'? This artifact's power will fuel something far more magnificent than your safe return."
    > 
    > *He crushes the orb deliberately, absorbing its energy as dark power courses through him. His form flickers, revealing glimpses of something far more sinister beneath.*
    > 
    > **Wizard:** "You've served your purpose. Now die knowing you helped doom your own world."
    > *Proceed to **The Transformation and Combat**.*

### The Transformation and Combat

> The droning immediately resumes reaching a deafening crescendo
> **Make a DC 15 Con saving throw** 
>
> *   The stone walls are now **slick and pulsing**, covered in a **thick, grotesque organic membrane**.
> *   **Pools of dark, viscous black ichor** seep up from cracks in the floor, emitting a foul stench.
> *   Scattered around the room are **writhing, fleshy sacks**, each twitching and bulging as if something struggles within. As you look around you also notices, the stalactites hanging from the ceiling vibrating from the droning, a couple of pieces of them fall off and hit the black ichor slowly sinking within. 
>
> A large, winged demonic fly like creature,  lands heavily on the central pedestal where the seekers Eye once rested, its insectile wings buzzing violently. Its drone rises again, threatening to split your skulls. At the same time as if reacting to the droning Three larval type insectoid creatures burst from the sacks, and start slithering toward you. 
>
> **Roll Initiative!**

## Part 4: Combat Encounter - Quick Reference

### **INITIAL SETUP**
- **Chasme:** AC 15, HP 84, Speed 20ft/Fly 60ft
- **3 Larvae:** AC 10, HP 15 (enhanced from original 22), Speed 30ft
- **Environment:** Every red area is the Black Ichor and every blue area is a membrane


## Phase 1 Strategy 
- Chasme attempts to keep its distance using hit and run tactics 
	- Chasme gets two turns during phase 1. 
- Larva will attempt to swarm the backline players
- Top of each round roll a d10, on a 10 another larva bursts from a membrane. 
- At any point when someone does something large, roll a d6, on a 6 a stalactite falls in a random square.
	- This includes every drone from the chasme. 
- The black ichor is difficult terrain, and when anyone step into it for the first time they must make either an Con saving throw or be poisoned.
- Destroying a larva seems to do mental damage to the chasme.
- Anywhere that radiant or holy damage or similar type effects are thrown seems to drive the ichor away. 

## Phase 2 Strategy 

 >As you strike the final blow against the chasme it falls to the ground lifeless. Before you can celebrate, demonic runes appear on the chasmes body and you can heart deep echoing laughter all around the chamber. As the Ichor that one permeated the chamber starts to rush towards the dead body, becoming absorbed and the fly grows larger, and larger. Life returning to its multi faceted eyes. 


- Chasme only gets 1 round now, its notiecably slower. 
- It is now surrounded by whatever larva are left.
- Larva exist to protect the chasme and get in the way
- Stalactites now fall on 5 or 6 
- there is no more black ichor except for where the Chasme spits goo
- The Chasmes Chest glows with the outline of its original body. Players can attempt to attack the original body at disadvantage, hitting the original body is an automatic critical hit. 

## Phase 3 
When the players defeat the Chasme, it explodes in a demonic wave of dark energy. The cavern that has been falling apart the entire fight, starts to collapse slowly in earnest. 

Players must escape the mines without being crushed. 
Every time they fail a check everyone that failed takes a 2d6 in falling rock damage. 
As a whole they have 7 rounds to escape the mines. 
Before each floor ask the players if they have a plan or specific direction on how they want to proceed for the level

Each floor should have a special roll or way to get out
Floor 3 
- If they go the shambling mound direction they all need to make Athletics or acrobatics checks. A group average above a 12 is enough to dodge any rocks and get through to floor 2
- If they go the other direction, they will need to dodge the light bats as they are attempting to leave as well
	- Have everyone roll a d20, any odd numbers get attacked by light thiefs 

Floor 2 
- If they go through the area with the large iron door, there needs to be a group strength check above a 13 to quickly get the door open and get everyone through
- If they go the opposite direction through the back tunnels I need a group athletics check with an average of 14 to get everyone through. 

Floor 1 
- If they leave to the east they will become trapped in the puzzle room and must quickly solve the puzzle again
	- Three minutes or so in real life
- If they go west, they need to make another group athletics or acrobatics check, dc 15

## **FLAVOR TEXT BANK**

### **Phase 1: The Swift Hunt**

- **When the Chasme uses its two turns:** _"The creature is a blur of motion, its buzzing wings carrying it across the chamber in the blink of an eye. It strikes from one side, then vanishes into the gloom above, only for its drone to reappear right behind you."_
- **When the Chasme attacks with its Proboscis:** _"The fly-demon lunges, its horrifying proboscis striking like a fencer's blade. It's not a simple bite; it's a violation, an attempt to siphon your very vitality through its needle-thin maw."_
- **When a Larva spawns:** _"One of the twitching sacks on the floor ruptures with a wet tearing sound. A new larva, slick with amniotic fluid, slithers out and immediately joins the hunt, drawn by the scent of your blood."_
- **When a Stalactite falls:** _"Your spell rips through the air, and the cavern groans in response. A dagger of stone the size of a man breaks loose from the ceiling, plummeting down to shatter on the floor where you stood a moment ago."_

### **Phase 2: The Hulking Brute**

- **When the Chasme moves (slower):** _"The engorged demon lumbers forward, each step shaking the floor. It is slower now, but heavier, its every movement filled with a terrifying, deliberate force."_
- **When it attacks:** _"It swings a clawed limb not with speed, but with brute, overwhelming power. It's less an attack and more an attempt to simply pulverize you into the pulsating floor."_
- **When a Larva intercepts an attack:** _"As you swing at the main beast, one of the remaining larvae hurls itself in the path of your blow, sacrificing its pathetic form with a wet crunch to protect its master."_
- **When attacking the weak spot:** _"You see it—a faint, ghostly outline of the wizard's original form glowing in the creature's chest. It's a desperate target, a sliver of hope in this grotesque monster, daring you to take the risk."_

### **Phase 3: The Escape**

- **General Collapse:** _"The demonic energy dissipates, but the damage is done. The groans of the cavern turn into a symphony of destruction. Cracks race across the walls and ceiling, and the floor beneath your feet heaves. This isn't a tremor; it's the mine's death rattle."_
- **On a failed check:** _"You stumble, a shower of rock and splintered wood crashing down where you were. You get through, but you've lost precious seconds, and the roar of the collapse behind you grows louder, hungrier."_
- **On a success:** _"With instinct born of terror, you dive through a collapsing archway just as it slams shut behind you. You don't have time to feel relief; the next section of the tunnel is already beginning to buckle."_

### **When Players Succeed (Fleeting Hope)**

- **On a solid hit:**
    - _"Your blade bites deep, and for a moment, the creature's incessant drone falters. It recoils, black ichor weeping from the fresh wound."_
    - _"The spell erupts against the creature's carapace, staggering it. It turns its multifaceted eyes upon you, a new, focused hatred burning within them."_
- **On a critical hit:**
    - _"A perfect strike! You bypass its chitinous armor entirely, striking something vital. The beast lets out a shriek of genuine pain, a sound far more terrifying than its droning."_
    - _"The arcane energy tears through the demon's form, causing it to convulse violently. The very air around it seems to thin as its connection to this plane wavers for a split second."_

### **When Players Fail (The Inevitable Reality)**

- **On a missed attack:**
    - _"The creature moves with an unnatural speed, your attack slicing through the empty space where it was a moment before. It doesn't even seem to register your attempt."_
    - _"Your weapon scrapes uselessly against its thick hide, the impact ringing up your arm. The monster doesn't even flinch, its attention already elsewhere."_
- **On a failed saving throw (vs. Drone/Poison):**
    - _"The droning intensifies into a physical force, rattling your teeth and blurring your vision. You fight to stay upright as your mind screams for silence."_
    - _"The foul ichor seeps into your boots, and a wave of nausea washes over you. A cold, debilitating weakness spreads through your limbs as the poison takes hold."_

### **When the Chasme Fails (A Glimmer of False Hope)**

- **On a failed saving throw:**
    - _"Your magic catches the beast off guard. It stumbles, its wings beating erratically as it fights off the debilitating effect of your spell."_
    - _"The demon roars in frustration as the holy energy sears its flesh, forcing it back. It glares at you, its attack momentarily forgotten in a wave of agony."_
- **On a missed attack:**
    - _"The creature lunges with its proboscis, but in its haste, the attack goes wide, embedding itself in the pulsating wall with a wet squelch. It struggles for a moment to pull it free."_
    - _"You manage to twist away just in time, the demon's clawed hand gouging a deep furrow in the stone floor right where you stood. The sheer force of the missed blow sends tremors through the ground."_.
