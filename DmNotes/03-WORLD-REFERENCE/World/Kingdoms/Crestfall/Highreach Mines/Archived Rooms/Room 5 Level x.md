- Description: As you gaze across the series of narrow ledges and deep pits, your eyes catch on a few details. Scattered near the edge are some splintered planks and lengths of rope, worn but possibly sturdy enough for a short crossing. The walls bear faint scratch marks and indentations, almost as if someone before you attempted to wedge something between the ledges. 

* The pits themselves are unforgiving, lined with rusted spikes, but you notice that the edges of the ledges look unevenly worn, with certain spots appearing smoother and slightly indented. These could be safer stepping points, though a misstep might leave someone hanging from the ledge. 

* Down below, the faint glint of an old, half-buried plank lies tangled in the spikes, hinting that past adventurers may have tried similar tactics to bridge the gaps. 
- Trap: Crossing the room requires careful maneuvering; one wrong step sends players into the pit (DEX save or take falling damage).
	- Increasing difficulty dex checks to get across the 15 feet wide and 30 feet long with ledges every 10 feet or so. 
	- 5 Dex checks to get across 2 DC 10, 2 DC 15 and one DC 17 
- Players can make the dex checks easier by making perception or survival checks to notice points on the ledges or in the room that make it easier to cross 
- Exits: North to [[Room 2 Level x]], East to [[Room 8 Level x]].
