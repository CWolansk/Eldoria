- Description:: As you step into this part of the mines, the flickering torchlight reveals goblins with sickly, shadowed skin, their features twisted and almost unnatural. They move in a restless patrol, muttering to each other in low, ominous whispers that echo off the stone walls. Their eyes glint with a dark energy, and as they catch sight of you, their movements become tense and deliberate, as if fueled by something more sinister than mere goblin mischief.
- Encounter: 2 Goblin Cursespitters and 2 goblin Spinecleavers 
- Exits: North to [[Room 1 level x]], Secret Exit East to [[Room 4 Level x]], South to [[Room 5 Level x]].
