- Description:: Ahead, guarding the staircase to the third level, stand two hobgoblins twisted by dark magic, their skin tinged with shadowy veins and their eyes gleaming with a faint, fiery glow. Each holds a crude torch soaked in pitch, the flames licking hungrily at the air, casting flickering shadows across their fiendish features. Beside them, a goblin underboss skitters nervously, his gaze darting between the hobgoblins and you, his hands resting on a vicious-looking dagger. He snarls as he spots you, signaling to his twisted companions, who raise their torches with a sinister, eager grin.
- Encounter: 2 Hobgoblin Incendiarists and a goblin underboss
- Treasure: Hidden beneath a rock, a small purse with 8 silver and a mysterious amulet that smells of old, ale-stained wood.
	- The amulet is an amulet of the drunkard
