- Description:: You enter a long, eerily silent corridor where dust hangs thick in the air, muting your footsteps. Scattered along the floor are rusted pickaxes, splintered handles, and a few battered helmets, all relics of long-abandoned mining efforts. Shadows pool in the corners, casting faint outlines of the forgotten tools, as if the miners might return at any moment to reclaim their gear.
