- Description:: You enter a small chamber dominated by a crude shrine, its stone surface covered in blackened symbols that twist and swirl ominously. At its center sits a goblin skull, hollow-eyed and grotesque, with thick, dark ooze dripping from its mouth and pooling beneath it. Above, a rough sign scrawled in jagged letters reads, “Bow to Chasme’s will, or face the darkness," casting a chilling shadow over the room and filling the air with a sense of foreboding.
- Clue: A sign on the shrine reads, “Bow to Chasme’s will, or face the darkness.”
	- If someone touches the skull, a surge of dark energy pulses from it, sending a shiver up their arm and leaving a cold, oily residue on their skin. Immediately, the shadowy symbols on the shrine begin to writhe and shift, as if alive, and a faint whisper fills the room—a guttural voice muttering praises to Chasme. The air grows thick and oppressive, and the one who touched the skull feels a sudden, sharp pain in their head as brief, haunting visions of twisted, demonic faces flash before their eyes.

If they fail a Wisdom saving throw, they become cursed with **Shadow's Mark** for the next hour:

- **Effect**: The marked individual feels a pull toward the depths of the mines, sensing the presence of nearby fiends or dark magic. They have disadvantage on perception checks involving light and suffer a feeling of unease in bright areas, as if shadows are trying to claim them.

Touching the skull again intensifies the curse, increasing its duration and making it harder to resist its pull.
- Exits: West to [[Room 2 Level x]], South to [[Room 7 Level x]].
