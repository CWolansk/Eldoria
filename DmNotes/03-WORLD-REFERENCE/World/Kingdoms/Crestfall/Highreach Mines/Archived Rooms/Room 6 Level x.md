- Description:: As you step into the chamber, your boots pad softly on a thick carpet of webbing that clings to the floor, stretching in sticky strands across the room. The walls are draped in dense, silken webs, some hanging down like veils, ready to ensnare anyone who brushes too close. In the center, the giant wolf spider waits, its legs twitching eagerly as it senses your presence, while two goblins lurk near the edges, grinning as they blend into the shadows. Every movement threatens to tangle you deeper into the webs, making each step treacherous as the goblins release the spider.
- Encounter: 2 Goblin Boss Archers and 1 Giant Wolf Spider.
- Treasure: Hidden beneath debris is a small satchel with 5 gold pieces.
- Exits: North to [[Room 3 Level x]], East to [[Room 9 Level x]].
