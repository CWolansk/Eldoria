- Description:: You enter a dimly lit chamber where patches of bioluminescent moss cling to the walls, casting an eerie, sickly green glow over everything. The moss seems to pulse faintly, almost like it's alive, illuminating a winding path that snakes across the room in patches of brighter green. The air feels thick and humid, carrying a faint, acrid smell
- Puzzle: Players must follow the glowing moss in the correct sequence to avoid triggering a poison spore trap.
- Survival/Perception check to notice how to walk across the room correctly. 
- ### **Effects of Disturbing the Moss:**
- **Poisonous Spores**: The moss releases a cloud of poisonous spores in a 10-foot radius, requiring anyone in the area to make a **Constitution saving throw**. On a failed save, the player takes poison damage and becomes **poisoned** for 1 minute, suffering disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
- **Lingering Toxicity**: The spores hang in the air for several minutes, creating a lingering hazard that obscures vision slightly and makes the area dangerous to move through repeatedly
### **Ways to Destroy the Moss:**
- **Fire**: The moss is flammable, and even a small flame (such as a torch) will cause it to burn away quickly. However, burning it releases additional smoke that can make visibility poor and create a temporary risk of inhalation (small Constitution save to avoid a coughing fit or minor damage).
- **Radiant Magic**: Radiant damage, such as a spell like _Sacred Flame_, can also destroy patches of the moss without causing any toxic side effects, as the spores are purged in the process.
- Exits: North to [[Room 4 Level x]], East to [[Room 10 Level x]].
