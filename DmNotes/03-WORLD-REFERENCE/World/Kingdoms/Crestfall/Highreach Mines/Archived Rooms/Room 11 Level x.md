- Description: In the center of the room, the crumbling altar stands as a haunting relic of a long-forgotten deity, its stone surface cracked and defaced, now coated in a thick layer of black ooze that seems to pulse faintly in the dim light. The sour stench intensifies as you approach, mingling with faint, unsettling whispers that echo from the shadows, as if beckoning you closer.

* Atop the altar lies an alluring **jeweled amulet**, partially embedded in the ooze but glinting with a strange, unnatural light. The gem at its center shifts between colors—a deep red, then a sickly green—almost hypnotic in its appeal. 
- ### **Trap Effect**:
	- **Trigger**: Touching the ooze-covered amulet or the altar itself activates the trap.
	- **Effect**: As soon as the altar or amulet is touched, dark tendrils of ooze spring forth, latching onto the one who disturbed it. They must make a **Wisdom saving throw** to resist the whispers’ influence, which attempt to draw them closer to the altar.
	    - **On Failure**: The player is entranced and compelled to touch the ooze directly, allowing it to seep into their skin and inflict minor necrotic damage. While entranced, they are also **paralyzed** until another player intervenes.
	- **Ongoing Effect**: The whispers begin to infect the mind of any player who has touched the altar, for the next 24 hours they have disadvantage on dexterity checks and saving throws
* ### **Breaking the Trap**:
	- **Radiant or Holy Magic**: Casting radiant or holy magic on the altar disrupts the whispers and weakens the ooze, allowing the players to safely retrieve the amulet.
	- **Physical Force**: If a player attempts to destroy the amulet, it will shatter, dispersing the ooze with a final pulse of necrotic energy that dissipates as the whispers fall silent.
- The amulet is not magical, but the jewel has been enchanted to change color and look magical.
- If players do detect magic, they get illusion and evocation magic
- Exits: West to [[Room 9 Level x]].
