- Description:: You enter a chilling chamber, where the walls are etched with dark, jagged symbols, each one radiating a faint, pulsing malevolence. The symbols, scratched deep into the stone, seem to shift slightly as you gaze at them, as if alive. The air feels thick and oppressive, pressing down on your chest and making it harder to breathe.
- **Trap Effect**:
	- **Trigger**: Stepping on one of the glowing symbols without dispelling or avoiding it.
	- **Effect**: The trapped symbol erupts in a burst of shadowy tendrils, which lash out and attempt to latch onto each player within a 10-foot radius. Anyone caught must make a **Dexterity saving throw**. On a failure, they are restrained as the tendrils wrap tightly around them.
	- **Ongoing Effect**: While restrained, players take minor necrotic damage each turn as the tendrils drain their life force, the dark energy sapping their strength.
	- **Escape**: Players can attempt a **Strength check** to break free, or another player can assist by dispelling the tendrils with radiant or magical light. Alternatively, targeting the symbol on the wall with radiant magic will weaken the tendrils and stop the trap momentarily.
* ***A Torn Scroll with Demonic Script**: Wedged into a crack in the stone near one of the fiendish symbols, the players find a fragment of an ancient scroll. The faded writing is in Abyssal, and a character proficient in the language (or with magic to translate it) can decipher phrases like “Chasme,” “corruption,” and “hunger for pure souls.” This scroll hints at the Chasme’s origins and suggests it has a demonic appetite for the life essence of the pure-hearted.
