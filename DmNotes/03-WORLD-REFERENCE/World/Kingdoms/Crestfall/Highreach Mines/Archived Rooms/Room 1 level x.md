Room 1: Entrance to Level 2

- Description:: You descend into the second floor of the Highreach Mines, where the air grows colder and heavier, carrying a faint metallic tang. The stone walls here are rougher and darker, with veins of dull ore visible in the rock, glittering faintly in the dim torchlight. Bits of debris from old mining activity are scattered across the floorâ€”broken picks, rusted chains, and splintered wood.
- Exits: South to [[Room 2 Level x]], East to [[Room 3 Level x]]. Stairway up to [[Room 10 Level 1]]
