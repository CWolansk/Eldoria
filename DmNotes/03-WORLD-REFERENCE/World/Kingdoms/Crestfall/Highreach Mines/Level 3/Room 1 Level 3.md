As you descend into the third level of the mine, the soft blue luminescent fungus thins out around you, its glow gradually giving way to a hazy red fog that seems to cling to the tunnel walls. Drifting deeper, you enter a chamber where a lone lantern sways gently from the ceiling, its dim light refracted by the crimson haze. You can see four separate mine cart tracks converge here, but the western passage has collapsed under a recent cave in.

Near the blocked exit, something catches your eyeâ€”amid the stones, there appears to be a small object secured against the wall. But its hard to make out through the fog.
