[[Cacklers]] 

As you lower yourselves through the crack in the ceiling, the red fog from above cascades into this rocky chamber, drifting across the floor in a slow, swirling haze. Right away, you notice a large boulder dominating the center of the cavernâ€”its edges just visible in the low, ruddy light. Around the southern side, a few scattered bones lie half-buried in dust, nearly unrecognizable from age and decay.

Faint echoes of pleas for help still drift from somewhere beyond the central rock.

When you work your way around it, you find a body with sandy blond hair, wearing a deep forest green armor that is now stained dark and punctured with numerous stab wounds. As you discover the corpse, the voices stop, replaced by loud, mocking cackles that echo from every corner of the chamber, the sound ricocheting through the lingering red fog.
