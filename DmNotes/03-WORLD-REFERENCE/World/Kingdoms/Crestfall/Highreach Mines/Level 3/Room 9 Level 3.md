As you step through the corridor, the buzzing in your ears grows steadily louder, and that red haze seems to thicken with each step. It’s as if you’ve crossed an invisible boundary—where the mine you’ve been navigating ends, and something far stranger takes its place. The natural rock and old support beams are still here, but they look twisted, out of alignment, like someone pulled the earth in all the wrong directions.

A broken mine cart track juts straight into a solid wall, then veers straight up along the stone as though gravity itself decided to shift. You can see small plateaus rising at odd angles, each with a cart perched precariously on top, as though left behind in a hurry—or possibly thrown there by force. It all gives you the sense that this place was once just another tunnel in the mine, but now... it’s been corrupted or reshaped by something far beyond normal means. The air buzzes with that droning, and the red glow flickers across every surface, lending the entire cavern an unsettling life of its own.
