As you follow the pair of mine cart tracks inward, you spot on the left several battered human banners, their faded colors now dulled by dust and time. On the right, dwarven banners cling to the stone walls, each one silhouetted in the hazy red fog that blankets this level of the mine. At the far end of the chamber, a sturdy iron door stands closed, even from the entrance you can see runes carved across its surface
