As you step into this chamber, the red fog clings more densely to the ground, swirling around your ankles with every footstep. A pair of iron doors lies face-down on the floor, amid pieces of armor and broken arrows. Jagged messages in goblin and a few dwarven runes are scrawled across those fallen doors and the surrounding walls:

- **No Entry to Goblins**
- **Danger**
- **Keep Out**
- **Nilbog Help Us**

- Nightstalkers last stand was here
