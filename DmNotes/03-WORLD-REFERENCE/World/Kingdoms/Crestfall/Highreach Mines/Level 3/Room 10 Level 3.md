[[Shambling mound Fight]] 

As you move forward, the rock beneath your feet gives way to a plush layer of green moss. The red glow youâ€™ve been trudging through fades into the background, replaced by a softer, green light. You can even feel the buzzing in your ears lessen, as though muffled by the moss itself.

Stepping fully inside, you find that the circular, rocky chamber is blanketed in this faintly glowing green carpet. Over on the western wall, a large mound of dirt and roots sits within a circle of crudely drawn runes, each line glowing with a matching green hue. 

- Inspecting the runes History or perception or arcana
	- Perception 
		- Definitely not by dwarves
		- The runes are dwarven in nature and crudely drawn
	- History or Nature
		- Based on how crude the runes are and how recent they seem you assume that they were carved by a goblin
	- Arcana check 
		- The runes are a mix of protective runes and Warding runes 
- Inspecting the mound 
	- If they step inside the rune circle the mound wakes up
	- If they don't step inside they will notice that they can see parts of an arm and a leg and something shifting inside the mound of dirt
