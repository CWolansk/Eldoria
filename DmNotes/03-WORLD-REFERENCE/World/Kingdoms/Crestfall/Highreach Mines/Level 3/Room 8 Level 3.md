As you head down this corridor, the red fog starts to thin out, giving way to a soft green glow. By the time you step into the chamber, the red haze has mostly faded, replaced by a thick carpet of luminous moss clinging to the floor and walls. Each step reveals more of that gentle green light, especially near the eastern exit where the moss grows even denser. Beneath that soft glow, you can make out the outlines of a few old cots and empty chests—now little more than a framework under the moss’s spreading embrace.

- If they try and go through the exit to the east they will run into the shambling mound 
	- a large mound of dirt and roots sits within a circle of crudely drawn runes, each line glowing with a matching green hue. 
	- Inspecting the runes History or perception or arcana
		- Perception 
			- Definitely not by dwarves
			- The runes are dwarven in nature and crudely drawn
		- History or Nature
			- Based on how crude the runes are and how recent they seem you assume that they were carved by a goblin
		- Arcana check 
			- The runes are a mix of protective runes and Warding runes 
	- Inspecting the mound 
		- If they step inside the rune circle the mound wakes up
		- If they don't step inside they will notice that they can see parts of an arm and a leg and something shifting inside the mound of dirt 

**Small Locked Box**

- **Description:** Hidden in a chest that’s nearly disintegrated. The lock is rusted but still functional.
- **Contents:** A simple healing potion or small stash of silver coins (10–15)

**Luminous Moss Sample**

- **Description:** If carefully harvested (DC 12 Nature or Survival), players can gather a handful of the glowing moss without harming it.
- **Use:** Can be used as a soft light source in dark areas (glow lasts about a day once removed) or as a reagent for a homebrew “Glow Salve” that could grant temporary low-light vision (with DM discretion).
