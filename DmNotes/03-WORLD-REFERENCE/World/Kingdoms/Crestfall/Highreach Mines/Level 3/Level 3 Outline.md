Level 3 is a half mine half fiendish hellscape. There are no goblin sentries on this level due to the amount of fiendish magic and monstrosities that are inhabiting this level. The bodies of the previous adventurers should also be found down here. 

Unless specifically stated the entire level is filled with red fog that provides dim light
- flavor only still dim light
