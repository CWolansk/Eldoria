**Entrance from the Moss Room (Buzzing Returns in Full Force):**  
Stepping in from the mossy corridors, you notice the soft green glow recedes, and with it, any hush you once felt. In its place, the buzzing surges back—louder than anywhere you’ve been so far, rattling your teeth with each pulse. A foul stench of rot hangs in the air, emanating from a heap of half-decayed corpses piled in the far corner. Dominating the center of the chamber, a circle of runes carved into the floor emits a deep crimson miasma, the intensity of which seems to draw all light and air into its twisted design.

**Entrance from Another Room (Buzzing Intensifies):**  
As you cross the threshold, the ever-present buzzing climbs another notch, vibrating through your skull. The red fog swirls thicker here, and your senses are hit by an overwhelming stench coming from a tangled mass of corpses heaped in the far corner. In the center, carved runes form a perfect circle in the stone, each symbol releasing a sinister red haze that seems to warp the glow of the chamber. It feels as if every scrap of energy in these mines converges on this one ominous spot.

Next to the pile of corpses you can see a hole that looks almost melted into the wall of the cavern leading downward.
