- As they enter the room 
	- As you press on, the red fog thickens, bathing the corridor in an oppressive crimson glow. Stepping into this chamber, you notice a pile of bones gathered in the southern corner, next to a small alcove, their whiteness sharp against the dim, ruddy light. The space itself appears empty—no fungus, no twisted growth—just that hazy gloom drifting across the floor and walls.

- When they reach the center of the room 
	- Then a wet, sloshing noise breaks the silence. From a small alcove to the south, a **gelatinous cube** oozes into view, its translucent mass tinged red by the fog. Suspended within you see a broad figure wearing dark iron armor, the hammer motif etched into the breastplate already dissolving. A large, angular war hammer floats behind him, drifting among scattered remains as the cube shudders forward.

Suspended within the cube is the body of [[Oren Hammerfist]]
