As you step into the room, several large wooden bins loom along the walls—each one labeled for a different type of mineral. Most seem picked clean, but bits of broken rock and rubble lie scattered underfoot.

Apart from the bins, the space is nearly bare. On the right side, the only real decoration is a large  dwarven banner pinned behind one of the smaller crates. 

If they examine the banner

You notice a simple yet precise design woven into the faded cloth: a pickaxe, a shovel, and a hammer, all crossed at the center. It’s a clear dwarven symbol, likely representing the pride they took in their mining craft. Only a few threads of the original color remain, but the workmanship still stands out in the dim light.
- as you are inspecting the banner you lift it up can see behind the banner, a rectangular doorway.
