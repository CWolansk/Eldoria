As you follow the mine cart tracks into this chamber, you notice rows of rusted tools—pickaxes and shovels—abandoned by carts still half-filled with stone. The whole place is choked with black and red mushrooms, each cluster shifting slightly in the hazy red fog.

As they enter the room, the mushrooms react to sound anytime that anyone speaks in this room the mushrooms around them send up a spore cloud that does 2d4 poison damage

As they enter the room, after a minute or so they should start hearing the cacklers talking. Which everytime the cacklers call for help. A small cloud of spores shoot up from the southern wall of the room. 
They can hear someone shouting 
- "HELP"
- "IM DOWN HERE"
- "PLEASE GODS HELP ME"
