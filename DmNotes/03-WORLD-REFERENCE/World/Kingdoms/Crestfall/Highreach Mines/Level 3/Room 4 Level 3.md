* Encounter :: 
* Reward :: 
* Exits :: South [[Room 5 Level 3]]

You exit from the hidden tunnel between the rooms, pushing aside another piece of cloth and enter into what appears to be a cramped and abandoned bunk room. Rows of stripped wooden buns and open foot chests line the walls, everything coated in a layer of disturbed dust. 
You can see a collapsed entrance on the far east side of the room, you can see a figured slumped against the rubble, wearing a torn crimson cape over dark steel armor. 

[[Thoren Ironfist]] is slumped against the wall. 
### When asked what happened to his party 
“We were exploring this level and came to a room with large iron doors where the buzzing was just inside of our skulls. We thought those doors would hold. Goblins had reinforced ’em, braced ’em from inside to keep that demon out. But the hinges blew apart like cheap tin. That Chasme… it swept in, flanked by its twisted minions. We tried to hold the line—my team fought tooth and nail—but it cut through us like we were nothing.”

### Asked how he escaped or ended up in this room 
“I looked into that spawn Baalzebuls eyes and  I—I couldn’t stand my ground. I was trembling, mind consumed by pure terror. Suddenly, all I could think of was running. My companions… they stayed to fight, but I abandoned them. I can still hear their screams”

### Asked what he's doing here now 
“I made it to the upper levels—should’ve kept going to the surface. But the guilt… it ate at me. I’d fled when my friends were cut down. Couldn’t live with that. So I turned around. Came right back down alone, figuring if I could avenge them or at least end that damned fiend, it’d be worth whatever happened to me. I knew it was a suicide mission, but it was the only choice I could stomach. Along the way I left scraps of parchment wherever I could. Quickly Wrote down things that could be useful anything that might help the next adventurers. Figured if I didn’t make it, at least some poor soul following behind might. I knew it wasn’t much, but… it was all I had left to give.”

### Asked why they were down here in the first place 
“We had these… dreams. An old wizard calling us, promising us fame and glory if we got to the bottom of the mine. We thought it was destiny—or a chance at something big. Guess we underestimated how deep these Mines ran. And then right as we were leaving we were approached by [[Alistair Goldman]] of the Merchants guild, he told us he had heard of an ancient artifact at the bottom of the mine, and offered a hefty sum if we’d deliver it straight to him, no questions asked. Greed… excitement… we figured two paydays were better than one. So that’s what led us deeper in—our plan was to find the artifact, get rich and famous all with one simple quest.”

Lore Information 
- The dwarves used the secret exit to sneak into the ore room at night and steal adamantine 
	- A forgotten note under one of the beds details that the dwarves believe one of the humans is suspicious of them and that they should stop or take everything and abandon the mine.
