#highreachMines #level1 
- Description :: Shrine Roome 
	- You enter a small, dimly lit chamber dominated by a crude shrine crafted from piled stones and bones, with scattered trinkets gleaming faintly in the shadowsâ€”clearly stolen and left as offerings. The walls are scrawled with jagged goblin carvings, their rough shapes barely discernible. Written in messy goblin script, a warning catches your eye: "All Goblins Leave Tribute"
	- anyone that puts something on the altar who is not a goblinoid will be blasted by goblinish energy, a sickly green wave of energy hits the adventurer squarely in the chest
		- this has the effect of the players being able to understand goblin for the next 10 minutes 
- Encounter :: Shrine trap 
- Reward :: None
- Exits :: West to [[Room 2 Level 1]], East to [[Room 9 Level 1]], Hidden trapdoor to [[Room 8 Level 1]].
