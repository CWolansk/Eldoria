- Description :: Secret Store room
	- you see stacks of old forgotten supplies piled up against the walls with some crumbling with age. Amid the clutter you see a single untouched crate
- Encounter :: None 
- Reward ::  An unopened crate filled with straw
	- within the straw you can find a pair of silver earrings worth 20 gold pieces and a tarnished silver goblet worth 10 gold pieces.
