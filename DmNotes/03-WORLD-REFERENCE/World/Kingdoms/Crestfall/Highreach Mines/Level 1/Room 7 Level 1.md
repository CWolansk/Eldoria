- Description :: Storage Room with goblin skeletons
	- You open the door and see what seems to be an old abandoned storage room with barrels and boxes stocking the shelves around the room. Sitting in the middle of the room are 3 goblin skeletons.
	- you get the feeling that these goblins set up the pressure plate trap but realized that they couldn't get back across their own trap and so they died in the storage room.
