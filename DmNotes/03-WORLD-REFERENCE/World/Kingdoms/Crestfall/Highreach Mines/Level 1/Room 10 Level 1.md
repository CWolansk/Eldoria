- Synopsis  ^b9efa1
	- Party had a surprise round and fought hobs and gobs 
		- gobs were easy, hobgoblins a little harder 
		- had both hobs and gobs have a bit of a powerup via shadow and black magic and ended the fight when I thought it was appropriate 
			- For story reasons it might have been cool to do a power up on last hob but make him easier to hit
	- Party found nightstalkers first journal entry
	- Party levelled up and ended session 4 after this fight.
