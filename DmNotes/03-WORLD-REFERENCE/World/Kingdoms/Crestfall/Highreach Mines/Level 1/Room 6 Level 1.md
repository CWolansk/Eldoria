#highreachMines #level1 
- Description :: Partially collapsed tunnel 
	- You find yourself in a narrow tunnel partially chocked with rubble. Loose stones crunch beneath your feet and the oppressive darkness seems to deepen as you move further into the mine. Along the walls, scrawled in crude common script, are a lot of weird warnings, specifically about flys 
	- "Big Flys eat big poo"
	- "shoo fly, don't bother me"
	- "Hate flys"
	- This way allows the party to sneak up behidn the hobgoblins in room 10 and get a surprise round if they are being quiet.
- Encounter :: None
- Reward :: None 
- Exits :: West to [[Room 3 Level 1]], East to [[Room 10 Level 1]]
