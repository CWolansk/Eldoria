[[Level 2 Outline|Level 2 Outline]]
**Description** :: Goblin Hub + sentry resting area
* If the party stealthily got past the door 
	* You continue on from the door down a short corridor, in the distance you can hear a group of goblins arguing loudly. 
	* As you enter the room, you can see old overturned mine carts with half finished maggoty meals on top, raggedy bed spreads lining the far walls, and in the center of the room are 3 goblins with their backs to you, engaged in a heated debate over what seems to be a game of cards. 
* If the party triggered the alarm 
	* You continue on from the door down a short corridor, the sound of water dripping somewhere in the distance is the only sound you can hear. 
	* As you enter the next room, you can see old overturned mine carts with half finished maggoty meals on top, some raggedy and unmade cots lining the far walls, and in the center of the room a makeshift table with some playing cards and a pile of copper and silvers on top
		* The goblins are hiding on either side of the doorway behind barrels and will jump out at the party when they enter the room 

**Encounter** :: Fight
- **2 Goblin Boss and 1 Goblin Underboss**: 
	- When the goblins die they explode in a wave of dark energy dealing a random curse, if a player is hit by another explosion the second curse will overwrite the first

**Reward** :: Small iron key, puzzle clue, room loot
- **Tangible Loot:** On the goblin boss’s belt is a small iron key.
    - The **Iron Key** could unlock a future storage room or shortcut further in the mines (we’ll define that room later).
- A small crate under the table contains 2 minor healing potions, providing the party with short-term sustenance and encouraging them to press on.

**Exits** :: West [[Room 5 Level 2]]<br>, South [[Room 6 Level 2]]<br>, East [[Room 7 Level 2]]<br>, North [[Room 2 Level 2]]
This room should offer multiple routes to prevent linearity:

- **Back North:** To Room 2 (the door they came through).
- **West Exit:** A narrower tunnel going slightly upward. Possibly leads to a side area (Room 5), maybe with storage or a different puzzle.
- **South Exit:** The main downward path continuing deeper into the mines (Room 6). It looks more heavily used, with clearer goblin footprints.
- **East Exit:** A partially collapsed passage that could be cleared or squeezed through (with effort) to reach a hidden chamber (Room 7). This might offer shortcuts or secret treasures but is less obvious.
