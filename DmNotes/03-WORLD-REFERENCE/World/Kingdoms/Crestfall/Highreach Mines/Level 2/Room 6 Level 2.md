**Description** ::  Goblin Forge
As you leave the goblin hub room, your path continues to slope downward. In the distance you can hear the repeated pinging of metal striking metal rhythmically. As you approach, you can feel the air start to heat up, and the blueish glow of the fungus around you gives way to a fiery red as you can see a forge being tended to by a large furry goblinoid and several smaller furry goblinoids, actively beating glowing red swords into shape.
