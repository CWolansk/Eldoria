**Purpose and Tone:**  

**Description** :: Small hidden goblin storeroom 
Behind the partially collapsed passage, the corridor narrows and bends sharply. After roughly 15 feet, it opens into a small, irregular chamber. The ceiling dips lower, forcing tall adventurers to stoop. The floor is covered in scattered debris: cracked wooden crates, old straw, and a few overturned buckets. Inside the room the party can find various food stuffs that the goblins have stored here for later consumption. Including salted meats, grog, and some slightly stale bread. 

**Encounter** :: None

**Reward** :: None

**Exits** :: West [[Room 4 Level 2]], Secret Exit to North [[Room 3 Level 2]]
