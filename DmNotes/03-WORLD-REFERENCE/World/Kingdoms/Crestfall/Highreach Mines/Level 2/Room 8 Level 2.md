**Purpose and Tone:**  

**Description** :: Large Iron Door puzzle

As you continue down the tunnel, it slopes ever deeper until the passage opens into a vast, cathedral-like cavern. The bent, rusted mining rails you’ve been following peel off in opposite directions, curling around a towering iron door on the far side of the chamber. Even from here, you can see dwarven runes etched into that door, faintly catching the glow of your light.

Off to one side, you notice a small makeshift station—a battered table holding a few half-used rolls of bandages and a couple of healing potions left uncorked, as though someone tended their wounds not too long ago. You can almost imagine them patching themselves up in a hurry, then pressing on toward that imposing metal gateway looming over the cavern wall.

Iron door : 
* The iron door has dwarven runes engraved all around it.
	* These are ancient dwarven runes that don't have a direct translation to common but are more arcane in nature, and don't have a meaning beyond locking the door unless a trigger phrase is said. 
	* The phase is usually a code word that can be spoken aloud in any language and it looks like the dwarves carved a riddle into the door.
		* probably so that some of the more forgetful dwarves or humans would be able to guess the passphrase if they forgot it. 

**Encounter** :: Puzzle
