**Description** :: Large Boss Fight 

As you step beyond the iron door, the cavern before you opens up into a wide space. Standing in the center, two hulking goblins grip oversized great axes—muscles straining in a way that almost defies reason. They lock eyes with you the instant the door swings open, and you can see them tense, ready to charge.

Further back, a massive goblin—nearly three times the size of its kin—stands chained against the far wall. A smaller goblinoid in a tattered cloak hovers close, staff in hand, dark tendrils of energy lashing out from his fingers and coiling around the huge goblin’s form. The moment you set foot inside, the two musclebound goblins let out a roar and rush straight at you, axes raised high.
