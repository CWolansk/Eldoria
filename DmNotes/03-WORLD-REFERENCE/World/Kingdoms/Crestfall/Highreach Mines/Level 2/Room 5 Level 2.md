**Description** :: Dwarven locked weapon cache
This corridor unlike the others, looks more recently carved out, and it was definitely not by human hands. The walls are scratched and roughly broken down with piles of rubble still lying on the ground, with only enough room for something slightly larger than your party to get through. 
The path leads to a large door that is featureless, with a lever on the far right and a dwarven inscription above the lever.
* anyone that inspects the lever will notice a small hole hidden on the side, that looks like it may fit a key. 

Dwarven Riddle. 
* Dwarves sit up on the highest peak
* though others often look down
* we left our anvils heat
* right quick for the metal crown

**Encounter** :: Dwarven Lock 
* The iron key that the party picked up from room 4 needs to slot into the lever and then the correct sequence will open the door. 
**Puzzle Mechanics (Example):**

1. Insert the iron key from Room 4 into the keyhole. This “arms” the puzzle.
2. The correct sequence, is up down left right
3. If the party sets the levers incorrectly three times, a grinding sound triggers and a dart trap fires from hidden holes in the wall (1d4 piercing damage and a DC 13 Con save or take 1d4 poison damage from old resin on the darts). After the trap fires, the puzzle resets and can be tried again.

**Clues and Aids:**

**Reward** :: Dwarven Tools
Solving the puzzle correctly opens the stone panel, revealing a small dwarven storage niche:
* a box is inside 
	* 1 adamantium bar (1000 gp) 
- A brittle scroll case containing a fragment of old dwarven notes (lore):
	- The dwarven scroll details how the dwarves and the men worked together to establish this mine for adamantium, but the vein ran dry around the third level. 
	- They had established this room to be able to hide some of the metal from the humans who owned the mines, as the dwarves believed that all metals in the earth rightly belonged to them. 
	- Thats why they've hidden this cache here so even if the humans kick the dwarves out they won't be able to get the refined adamantium that they have hidden here. 

**Exits** :: East [[Room 4 Level 2]]
