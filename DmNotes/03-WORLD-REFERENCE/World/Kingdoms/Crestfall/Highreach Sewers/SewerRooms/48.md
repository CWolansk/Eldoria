Encounter :: 
Description :: As you step into the large, rectangular room, the low, rhythmic murmur of chanting fills the air, echoing off the damp stone walls. On either side of the room, raised platforms extend along the walls, where robed cultists stand in solemn rows, their faces hidden in shadow as they chant in unison. Flickering torches cast an eerie glow, illuminating strange symbols painted in dark red across the walls and floor. In the center of the room lies a large, rough-hewn stone slab, stained and cracked, as though it has been the focal point of countless rituals. The cultistsâ€™ voices rise and fall, creating an unsettling harmony that seems to thrum in your bones, as if the very room itself is alive with dark purpose.
