Encounter :: 
Description :: As you step into the small alcove, the walls seem to close in, amplifying the damp, musty smell of the sewers. The faint, rhythmic sound of chanting drifts toward you from somewhere ahead, low and haunting, sending a chill through the air. It rises and falls in unsettling tones, echoing down the passage, hinting at something sinister awaiting in the room beyond.
