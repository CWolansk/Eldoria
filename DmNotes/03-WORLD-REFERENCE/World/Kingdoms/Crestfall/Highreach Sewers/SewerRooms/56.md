Encounter :: 
Description :: As you step into the large, circular chamber, the air grows thick and damp, with a sour, metallic tang that clings to the back of your throat. The center of the room is dominated by a vast, dark pool of murky water that stretches from wall to wall, its surface almost eerily still. The water is black as ink, with faint ripples drifting outward from unseen depths, giving the impression that it drops off sharply just a few steps from the edge. Broken stone ledges line the perimeter, slick with grime, and a few rusted pipes extend over the waterâ€™s edge, occasionally dripping with a hollow plink that echoes around the chamber. Shadows dance along the walls, their shapes distorted and unsettling, as if something below is stirring just out of sight.
