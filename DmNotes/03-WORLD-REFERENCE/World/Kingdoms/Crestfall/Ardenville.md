#Ardenville

Ardenville clings to the northern shore of briny **Lake Arden**, a refuge for small crews who dare not brave the monster‑haunted ocean. Founded generations ago by Highreach fishers seeking calmer waters, the town grew where kelp‑choked shallows form a natural breakwater rich with catch.

## History
- **Safe Harbor.** Early settlers hauled their catch into a yawning limestone cove and built stout piers and watchtowers to guard against river trolls and lake serpents, creating one of the few dependable ports in northern Crestfall.
- **Lake Wardens.** During the goblin raids of decades past, Ardenville’s boats patrolled the misty expanse of Lake Arden, keeping trade flowing to Highreach.
- **Storm-wrecked Warehouse.** A century ago, a freak squall ripped apart the original storage warehouse; its timbers now sag and the roof yawns open to the sky.
- **Cliffside Port.** Where the southern cliffs rise toward Highreach’s plateau, a winch-lift and dock now transfer Ardenville’s catch and goods up the sheer face.
- **Guild Influence.** The [[HighReach Merchants Guild]] maintains warehouses along the docks and administers the cliffside port, with guildmaster [[Alistair Goldman]] now sponsoring a grand race to cement their hold on lake commerce.

## Notable NPCs
- [[Isolde Fairweather]] – pragmatic mayor descended from generations of net‑menders.
- [[Kellen Redshore]] – meticulous harbormaster who knows every hull on the lake.
- [[Mira Softstep]] – halfling innkeeper of the Netted Nymph, purveyor of gossip and stew.
- [[Gregor Woods]] – captain of the lake guard, ever watchful for smugglers and monsters.
- [[Edda Netsong]] – dwarf guildmistress of the Fisherman’s Guild, stubborn as barnacles.

## Upcoming Events
On the **15th day of the fall season**, Ardenville hosts the **Lake Arden Boat Race**. Sponsored by [[Alistair Goldman]] and the Merchants Guild, the competition offers gold and the seized prize vessel *The Tipping Tankard*. Locals whisper that the guildmaster’s motives reach beyond celebration—especially after his recent clashes with certain adventurers.

## The Ruined Warehouse
Sailors approaching from the lake spot the leaning shell of Ardenville’s first warehouse long before they see the cottages. Salt‑eaten beams jut at odd angles, and algae slicks the shattered stone floor where crates once stood. Most goods have long since been hauled away by rightful owners or bandit crews, but rumors say squatters and oozes still lurk inside the shadowed corners. Town leaders debate whether to rebuild or raze the hazard.

## The Kelp Beds
Golden strands of kelp sway in the protected shallows, visible well before a boat rounds the docks. Fishers once dried nets on pilings driven among the fronds, but storms snapped the supports and the beds now tangle rudders and hide slime eels. Lantern light from the pier turns the swaying mass into a shimmering green curtain at night.

## Guilds and Politics
- **Merchants Guild.** Warehouses dominate the main pier, and guildmaster [[Alistair Goldman]] presses for higher docking fees while controlling the cliffside port feeding Highreach.
- **Fisherman’s Guild.** Led by [[Edda Netsong]], local crews band together to protect their haul and traditions.
- **Adventurers Guild Outpost.** A modest chapter posts jobs in the Netted Nymph and escorts boats through monster‑haunted shallows.
Smiles hide simmering tensions: the Merchants Guild covets control, the Fisherman’s Guild resists, and adventurers often mediate disputes—especially over who may clear the kelp beds or secure the storm‑ruined warehouse. Kellen Redshore still holds Grumm Grog Guzzler’s impounded ship as collateral for unpaid fees, a reminder of the guild’s reach.

## Quest Hooks
- **Secure the Collapsing Warehouse.** Mayor [[Isolde Fairweather]] wants the storm‑battered building inspected and cleared of threats before demolition.
- **Kelp Bed Cleanup.** The Fisherman’s Guild pays for thinning the eel‑infested kelp beds.
- **Missing Netters.** A skiff vanished beyond the mist line; [[Gregor Woods]] seeks trackers before the lake claims more.
- **Sabotaged Sails.** Unknown hands slice race competitors’ rigging; [[Isolde Fairweather]] wants discreet investigators.
