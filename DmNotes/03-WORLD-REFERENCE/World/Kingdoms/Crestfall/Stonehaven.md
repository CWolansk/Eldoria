#Stonehaven

Stonehaven clings to the southeastern edge of the vast [[Blackwood Forest]], a fortress-settlement where civilization makes its stand against the wild. Founded three generations ago by rangers and trappers seeking rich hunting grounds, the village has evolved into Crestfall's premier frontier outpost - a place where skilled woodsmen, determined guards, and wary merchants create an uneasy but functional community on the edge of the unknown.

## History

- **Ranger's Haven.** Founded when Highreach's expanding population pushed hunters and rangers to seek new territories, Stonehaven began as a seasonal hunting camp where the forest's edge offered both abundant game and natural defensive positions.
- **The Great Hunt.** Fifty years ago, a legendary dire bear terrorized the region until Stonehaven's hunters organized the successful hunt that cemented the village's reputation for skill and courage.
- **Forest Guardian Compact.** During the goblin invasions, Stonehaven's rangers developed sophisticated patrol networks and early warning systems that protected not just their village but surrounding settlements.
- **The Watchtower.** Twenty years ago, increased monster activity prompted construction of the great stone watchtower that now dominates the village's silhouette and serves as both lookout and final refuge.
- **The Sealed Gates Crisis.** Six weeks ago, new Mayor [[Ingrid Stoneheart]] ordered complete isolation, sealing the gates and cutting all contact with the outside world under mysterious circumstances detailed in [[The Sealed Gates of Stonehaven]].

## Notable NPCs

- [[Ingrid Stoneheart]] – enigmatic mayor hiding a desperate warlock pact made to protect the town
- [[Elias Thorn]] – master ranger with unmatched knowledge of Blackwood Forest's dangers
- [[Astrid Ironfist]] – disciplined guard captain torn between loyalty and growing doubts
- [[Vera Shadowpeak]] – experienced guild leader managing pressure from regional authorities
- [[Hilda Ravenshadow]] – mysterious wizard who secretly knows about the supernatural threats
- [[Gunnar Ironforge]] – dwarven blacksmith crafting weapons to face escalating dangers

## Current Events

The village suffers under [[The Sealed Gates of Stonehaven]] crisis, where Mayor Stoneheart's isolation order has created economic hardship, social tension, and political complications. Unknown to most residents, the Mayor made a warlock pact with an ancient fey entity to protect against supernatural threats, but the entity's demands grow increasingly sinister.

**Immediate Situation:** Guards refuse entry to all outsiders, stranded merchants camp outside the walls, and townspeople grow restless under unexplained isolation policies.

## The Watchtower

Rising sixty feet above the village center, the stone watchtower serves as Stonehaven's most visible landmark and last line of defense. Rangers maintain constant watch for threats emerging from Blackwood's depths, while the structure's thick walls and elevated position make it nearly impregnable. The tower's bells warn of danger and coordinate defensive responses across the settlement.

## Blackwood Forest Border

Where Stonehaven ends, true wilderness begins. Ancient trees form a natural wall that has stood since before human settlement, their massive trunks and interwoven canopy creating perpetual twilight beyond the village's cleared perimeter. Experienced guides know safe paths through the outer reaches, but even they speak of deeper places where ancient powers stir and mortal feet should not tread.

## Guilds and Politics

- **Adventurers Guild.** Led by [[Vera Shadowpeak]], the local chapter struggles to maintain connections with regional headquarters while supporting isolation policies they privately question.
- **Frontier Rangers.** Master [[Elias Thorn]] coordinates informal networks of hunters and guides who patrol the forest edge and train village defenses.
- **Merchants Guild.** Local member [[Erik Timber]] faces severe challenges maintaining supply chains and customer service under the sealed gates policy.
- **Town Guard.** Captain [[Astrid Ironfist]] maintains discipline while questioning orders that increasingly isolate the community from its regional support networks.

Political tensions simmer as the isolation policy strains relationships between pragmatic residents who understand regional trade dependencies and security-focused leaders who emphasize protection from forest threats.

## Quest Hooks

- **Breaking the Siege.** Investigate why Stonehaven's gates remain sealed and help resolve the underlying supernatural crisis
- **Forest Reconnaissance.** Guide expeditions into Blackwood's depths to map changing supernatural phenomena
- **Supply Line Restoration.** Escort vital goods through increasingly dangerous forest routes
- **Ancient Mysteries.** Explore pre-settlement ruins deeper in the forest that predate human presence
- **Political Mediation.** Navigate complex relationships between isolation policies and regional trade networks

## Read-Aloud Descriptions

### Approaching the Gates
You crest the final hill before Stonehaven and see tall wooden palisades stretching between natural stone outcroppings, creating an impressive defensive perimeter. The village's famous watchtower rises like a stone finger against the dark wall of Blackwood Forest beyond. Guards patrol the ramparts with obvious discipline, but something feels wrong - no merchants' wagons wait outside the gates, no travelers come and go along the approach road. As you near the main entrance, armed sentries step forward with hands on weapon hilts, their expressions mixing professional alertness with uncomfortable tension.

### Inside the Village
The village center opens into a practical square dominated by a large stone fire pit where villagers gather despite the midday hour. Sturdy timber and stone buildings line well-maintained streets, their construction speaking to both frontier practicality and surprising prosperity. Animal pelts hang from many eaves, and the sound of Gunnar's hammer rings steadily from the smithy. Yet an undercurrent of unease permeates the scene - conversations stop when strangers approach, children stay closer to their parents than seems natural, and too many glances drift toward the looming forest beyond the walls.

### The Adventurers Guild
The guildhall stands near the village's eastern edge, its familiar crossed sword and shield emblem providing welcome reassurance in this tense frontier settlement. Inside, maps of the local wilderness cover every wall, marked with notes about safe routes, dangerous territories, and seasonal creature patterns. The common room's stone hearth crackles invitingly, but the usual bustle of coming and going adventurers is conspicuously absent - only local members occupy the chairs and tables, their conversations hushed and their eyes frequently checking the windows that face the forest.
