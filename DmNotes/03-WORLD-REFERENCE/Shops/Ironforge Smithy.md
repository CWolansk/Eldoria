# Ironforge Smithy

**Owner:** [[Gunnar Ironforge]]  
**Type:** Blacksmith & Weaponsmith  
**Location:** Eastern edge of [[Stonehaven]]  
**Specialty:** Frontier weapons and survival equipment

## Shop Description
A robust stone and timber workshop where the constant ring of hammer on anvil echoes through the day. The large chimney constantly billows smoke, and the glow of multiple forges can be seen through reinforced windows. Heavy wooden doors are reinforced with iron bands, and the building's thick walls contain the heat and noise of intensive metalworking.

## Interior
The workshop is meticulously organized with multiple forge stations, each designed for different types of work. Racks of completed weapons line the walls - swords, spears, axes, and specialized hunting implements. A display case near the counter showcases Gunnar's finest work, while shelves hold an impressive array of traps, tools, and metal components. The air carries the scents of hot metal, coal smoke, and the oils used to finish completed work.

## Specialties & Services
- **Custom Weapons:** Superior quality arms designed for frontier conditions (+1 damage, 25% price increase)
- **Armor Repair:** Expert maintenance and modification of protective gear
- **Trap Creation:** Mechanical snares and devices for hunting and defense
- **Tool Crafting:** Specialized implements for rangers, miners, and craftsmen
- **Magical Metalwork:** Can work with unusual materials and enchanted metals

## Current Inventory
- **Weapons:** Longswords, battleaxes, hunting bows, crossbow bolts, spears
- **Armor:** Chain mail, leather armor, shields, helmets
- **Tools:** Mining picks, craftsman's tools, survival gear
- **Traps:** Bear traps, snares, caltrops, specialized hunting devices

## Prices & Quality
All items are 10-25% more expensive than standard but offer superior durability and craftsmanship. Weapons gain +1 to damage rolls, armor provides +1 AC bonus, and tools grant advantage on relevant skill checks. Custom orders take 1-3 weeks depending on complexity.

## Current Challenges
The sealed gates have created several problems:
- **Material Shortage:** Cannot acquire specialty metals and components
- **Customer Loss:** Traveling adventurers and hunters cannot reach the shop
- **Apprentice Isolation:** Cut off from dwarven smithing networks for training
- **Equipment Demands:** Town guard needs more gear but payment is increasingly difficult

## Plot Hooks
- **Supply Run:** Needs party to acquire rare metals from dangerous locations
- **Guard Equipment:** Commission to create weapons for escalating supernatural threats
- **Apprentice Training:** Requests for escort to Ironpeak for traditional dwarven techniques
- **Ancient Techniques:** Discovery of old notes about working with magically reactive metals
