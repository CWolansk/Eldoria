# Mystic Wares

**Owner:** [[Hilda Ravenshadow]]  
**Type:** Magic Shop & Supernatural Consultancy  
**Location:** Near town center in [[Stonehaven]]  
**Specialty:** Protective magic and supernatural detection

## Shop Description
A two-story building marked by crystal wind chimes that create haunting melodies in the breeze. Dark wood construction features mystical symbols carved around the doorframe and windows. Soft lights glow from within at all hours, and the scent of herbs and incense drifts from the constantly open door. The building seems to absorb sound, creating an island of quiet in the busy village.

## Interior
Dimly lit shelves line the walls, filled with bottles, crystals, dried herbs, and artifacts of uncertain origin. Candles and small magical lights provide illumination that shifts color subtly throughout the day. The air is thick with herbal scents and something harder to identify - the sensation of magic itself. A consultation area near the back allows for private discussions about magical matters.
