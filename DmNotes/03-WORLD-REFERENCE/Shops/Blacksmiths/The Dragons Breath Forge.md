"The Dragons Breath Forge" is a grand establishment with a facade adorned with intricate metalwork depicting scenes of legendary battles and heroic deeds. Inside, the forge is filled with the steady rhythm of hammer on anvil, and the air is thick with the scent of hot metal and leather. Display racks hold beautifully crafted pieces of armor and weapons, each one a testament to Thorin's unmatched skill. The forge itself is a marvel of engineering, with enchanted tools and a glowing furnace that never cools.
