## Read-Aloud Text Standards

### Voice & Perspective
- **Second-person, present tense**: "You see..." not "The party sees..."
- **Sensory focus**: Include at least two senses per description

### Length & Structure
- **2-6 sentences** per read-aloud block
- **Opening hook**: Start with immediate sensory detail
- **Atmosphere building**: Include details that reinforce high-magic setting
- **Implicit choices**: End with openings for multiple approaches

### Eldoria-Specific Atmosphere

## Mechanics & Game Balance

### DC Standards
Use **rounded DCs**: 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20
- **DC 10-12**: Routine challenges
- **DC 14-15**: Moderate challenges  
- **DC 16-18**: Hard challenges
- **DC 20**: Heroic challenges

### Alternative Approaches
Always provide at least **three approach options**:
1. **Combat**: Direct confrontation
2. **Social**: Negotiation, deception, intimidation
3. **Stealth/Skill**: Avoiding or circumventing challenges
4. **Creative**: Magic item use, environmental manipulation, "I Know a Guy"

### Scaling Guidance
Include simple scaling for party level variance:
- **Weaker**: Remove creatures, reduce HP/damage, lower DCs
- **Stronger**: Add creatures, increase HP/damage, raise DCs, add environmental hazards
- **Alternative**: Change tactics, add waves, include legendary actions

## Magic Item Design Philosophy

### Eldoria Magic Item Principles
1. **Beneficial Effect**: Clear, useful mechanical advantage
2. **Quirky Drawback**: Minor complication that creates roleplay opportunities
3. **Social Hook**: Potential to create new story threads or complications
4. **Setting Integration**: Fits naturally into high-magic world

### Rarity Guidelines
- **Common**: Minor convenience with amusing side effect
- **Uncommon**: Useful ability with manageable drawback
- **Rare**: Significant power with meaningful consequence
- **Very Rare**: Major ability with notable complication
- **Legendary/Artifact**: Campaign-defining power with story-altering effects

### Example Formats
```
**Quirky Item Name**
*Type*, rarity
*Helpful mechanical effect*. *Amusing or complicating side effect that creates roleplay opportunities*.
```

## Encounter Design Standards

### Structure Format
Use these consistent headings:
- **Hook**: Why party encounters this situation
- **Read Aloud**: Initial scene description
- **Approaches**: Multiple solution options
- **Checks**: Specific skill challenges with clear outcomes
- **Combat**: Tactics and environment if conflict occurs
- **Consequences**: Short and long-term results
- **Connections**: How this ties to larger campaign threads
- **Scaling**: Adjustments for different party levels

### Tactical Considerations
- **Intelligent Enemies**: Use cover, focus fire, retreat at 25% HP
- **Environmental Features**: Provide tactical options for both sides
- **Reinforcements**: Waves based on time or triggers, not automatic
- **Morale**: Enemies surrender, flee, or negotiate when appropriate

### Social Integration
- **Party Member Spotlights**: Include opportunities for each character's strengths
- **Background Relevance**: Tie to character histories and guild memberships
- **Consequence Chains**: Actions here affect future encounters and relationships

## Writing Tone & Voice

### Campaign Atmosphere
- **Heroic but Personal**: World-threatening stakes with individual character growth
- **Optimistic Consequences**: Actions matter and can improve the world
- **Magic Mundane**: High magic means magical solutions and problems are normal
- **Social Complexity**: Politics and relationships drive as much conflict as monsters

### Humor Integration
- **Magic Item Mishaps**: Amusing but not debilitating side effects
- **Social Awkwardness**: Misunderstandings from diverse party composition
- **Bureaucratic Comedy**: Guild paperwork, merchant regulations, kingdom politics
- **Character Quirks**: Party member personalities creating humorous situations

### Serious Moments
- **Artifact Discoveries**: Treat with appropriate weight and mystery
- **Wizard Threat**: Maintain underlying tension of demonic invasion
- **Character Growth**: Respect player investment in character development
- **Kingdom Politics**: Real consequences for diplomatic and military decisions
