	- Mound gets to go twice per round
- Traps
	- Circle of Runes on the floor, whenever a character steps on a specific Rune they get a random status effect 
	- Lightning Bolt : **Lightning discharge**: A jolt of lightning crackles out in a 15-foot radius. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity save DC 15. On a fail, they take 2d6 lightning damage (half on success).  
	- I : **Confusion**: Choose either an _Illusionary duplicate_ effect (like _Mirror Image_) or a short _Confusion_ effect. For a Confusion effect, each creature in a 10-foot radius makes a Wisdom DC 15 save or falls under the _confused_ condition for 1 round, causing them to lose control of movement/attack.
	- E : **Entangling Vines**: Strands of ghostly vines erupt in a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the area must make a Strength save DC 15 or be **Restrained** by vines for up to 1 minute (with repeated attempts to break free each round).

	- B : **Sleep Spell**: The rune unleashes a _Sleep_ effect over everyone starting with the lowest hp (e.g., 5d8 worth of hit points). Any creatures with HP under that total fall unconscious for 1 minute or until they take damage (standard Sleep spell rules).
	- C : **Icy Blast**: A burst of freezing air in a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the area makes a Constitution save (DC 15) or takes 2d6 cold damage and is _slowed_ (speed halved) until the end of their next turn (half damage and no slow on a success).
