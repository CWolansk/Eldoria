  "readAloud": "Don Gnocianno adjusts his pinstripe vest and smooths his meticulously waxed rat-tail beard as he presents a sealed wooden crate, roughly the size of a wine case but noticeably heavier. 'My dear exterminators,' he says with theatrical flourish, 'we have an opportunity to expand our pest control services to the fine port city of Ardenville. This shipment contains our most advanced rat control suppliesâ€”quite revolutionary, really.' His golden tooth glints as he grins, but you notice his eyes don't quite match his jovial tone. The package bears an official-looking Exterminators Guild seal, yet something about the careful way he handles it suggests this is no ordinary pest control equipment.",
  "hook": "Don Gnocianno offers the party 50 gold pieces for what he describes as a simple delivery to establish new guild services in Ardenville. The job seems straightforward, but careful observation reveals inconsistencies in his explanation.",
