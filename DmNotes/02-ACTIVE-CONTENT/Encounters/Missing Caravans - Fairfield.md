# The Missing Caravans Crisis
*A Multi-Part Investigation and Combat Encounter*

## Encounter Overview

**Situation**: Six merchant caravans have vanished over three months while traveling to/from Fairfield. The attacks appear random, but careful investigation reveals a sophisticated bandit operation with inside information.

**Stakes**: Fairfield's economy is collapsing as merchants refuse to travel. The party must stop the attacks before the town's trade network permanently collapses.

**Expected Duration**: 2-4 sessions depending on approach and party engagement

**Party Level**: 3-5 (scales with additional enemies and complications)

## Phase 1: Investigation in Fairfield

- Bandits knew exactly what cargo each wagon carried

- Bandits seemed to know which merchants were traveling but not their exact timing

**From Guard Captain Ironfist**:
- Attacks have no obvious pattern in timing or route
- No bodies found at attack sites (suspicious)
- Increased patrols haven't encountered any bandit activity
- Suspects inside information but can't prove it

**From Master Trader Goldleaf**:
- Caravan manifests are filed with the Harbor Authority for insurance
