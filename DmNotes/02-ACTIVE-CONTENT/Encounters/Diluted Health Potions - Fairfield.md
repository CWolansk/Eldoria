# The Diluted Health Potions Scheme
*An Investigation and Social Encounter*

## Encounter Overview

**Situation**: A sophisticated crime family led by Valeris "Silk" Shadowmere has been diluting health potions and selling them at reduced prices through street dealers, undercutting legitimate merchants while potentially endangering adventurers who rely on full-strength healing.

**Stakes**: The scheme threatens honest merchants, corrupts town officials, and could expand into other magical consumables. Left unchecked, it may evolve into artifact smuggling operations.

**Expected Duration**: 1-2 sessions depending on investigation depth and resolution approach

**Party Level**: 3-5 (social encounter with potential combat)

## Discovery Methods

### Option 1: Merchant Complaints
**Trigger**: Party visits Fairfield Provisions or other general stores
**Thom Barnaby** (General Store Owner) approaches party privately:

*"I hate to bother you folks, but I've got a problem that's affecting my business. Someone's been selling health potions on the streets for 25 gold instead of the standard 30. At first I thought maybe they were just desperate merchants dumping stock, but it's been going on for weeks. Worse, I've had two customers come back complaining that the potions they bought elsewhere didn't heal as much as expected. I can't prove anything, but something's not right about this."*

### Option 2: Street Approach
**Trigger**: Party is walking through marketplace or tavern district
**Marcus "Quick-Tongue" Delaney** approaches with seemingly friendly offer:

*"Adventurers! You look like folks who understand value. I've got something special for youâ€”genuine healing potions, fresh from the alchemist's workshop, and I can offer them for just 25 gold each. That's a bargain you won't find in the regular shops. What do you say? How many can I put you down for?"*

### Option 3: Guard Captain Request
**Trigger**: Party visits Adventurers Guild or interacts with town guards
**Guard Captain Ironfist** requests discrete assistance:

*"I need someone I can trust to look into something. We've had reports of substandard magical items entering the market, but every time my guards investigate, the trails go cold. I suspect there's an organized operation with connections to people who can warn them when official investigations start. Interested parties might want to start by asking merchants about unusual competition or customers reporting defective goods."*

- **Evidence Destruction**: Fire risk to important documents and supplies

### Follow-up Hooks

The dilution techniques require professional knowledge:
