## Overview
**Type**: Mixed (Social/Exploration with potential Combat)  
**Kingdom**: Crestfall (Highreach to Ardenville)  
**Party Level**: 4  
**Duration**: 1-2 sessions  

[[Don Gnocianno]] from the [[Exterminators Guild]] offers the party what appears to be a simple courier job, but it's actually a test of their willingness to become complicit in criminal activities while providing perfect cover for money laundering operations.

## Hook
Don Gnocianno offers the party 50 gold pieces for what he describes as a simple delivery to establish new guild services in Ardenville. The job seems straightforward, but careful observation reveals inconsistencies in his explanation.

## Read-Aloud Text
> Don Gnocianno adjusts his pinstripe vest and smooths his meticulously waxed rat-tail beard as he presents a sealed wooden crate, roughly the size of a wine case but noticeably heavier. "My dear exterminators," he says with theatrical flourish, "we have an opportunity to expand our pest control services to the fine port city of Ardenville. This shipment contains our most advanced rat control suppliesâ€”quite revolutionary, really." His golden tooth glints as he grins, but you notice his eyes don't quite match his jovial tone. The package bears an official-looking Exterminators Guild seal, yet something about the careful way he handles it suggests this is no ordinary pest control equipment.

## Multiple Approaches

## DM Notes

### Moral Complexity
This encounter deliberately avoids a clear "right" answer. The party must decide:
- Is guild loyalty worth potential criminal complicity?
- Can they maintain their heroic reputation while working with criminals?
- How far will they go for practical advantages (criminal connections, money, information)?

### Pacing Tips
- Front-load investigation opportunities so players don't feel trapped
- Provide multiple exit points if players want to refuse
- Scale consequences based on player choices rather than punishing investigation

### Campaign Integration
- This encounter sets the tone for the party's relationship with the [[Exterminators Guild]]
- Success establishes criminal contacts that could be useful for the artifact quest
- Failure doesn't close doors but changes the nature of future guild interactions
