Location :: #Ardenville
Profession :: #Harbormaster
Description :: Tall half‑elf with salt‑streaked hair and a ledger always in hand. Kellen knows every crew, cargo, and hidden inlet of Lake Arden.
Alive? :: Yes
Notes :: Collects docking fees for the Merchants Guild at the cliffside port, judges starting positions for the [[Lake Arden Boat Race]], and warns sailors away from the kelp beds now crawling with slime eels. He keeps Grumm Grog Guzzler's impounded ship under watch and stations guards near the collapsing warehouse to deter squatters.
