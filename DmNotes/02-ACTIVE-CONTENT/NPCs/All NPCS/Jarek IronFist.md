[[Jarek Ironfist gets killed]] 
[[Merchants Guild Quest]] 

Jarek Fights with a [bloodrage greataxe ](https://5e.tools/items.html#bloodrage%20greataxe_bmt)
Jarek has pictures on him of the Merchants guild guildmaster visiting prostitutes and 40 gold, 15 silver 

**Jarek Ironfist** is a rugged, imposing figure in his late 40s, with a battle-hardened physique and a face that tells the story of a life spent in the thick of conflict.

The mercenary is tall and broad-shouldered, he has several faded scars that criss cross his arms with one deep scar that runs from his left eyebrow to his cheek. He's wearing reinforced leather armor and iron pauldrons marked with faint etchings resembling hammers and he has a large two handed war axe strapped to his back. 
    
- **Mannerisms**: Jarek speaks with a low, gravelly voice and has a habit of sizing people up with a quick, assessing glance. He often cracks his knuckles when he’s thinking, and when he’s deep in thought, he fiddles with a simple iron ring he wears on his left hand—a keepsake from his younger years. His speech is blunt and to the point, with little tolerance for weakness or hesitation.

- Backstory: Jarek is the leader of a mercenary band once employed by the Merchants Guild. They were dismissed without pay after a guild deal went sour, and Jarek blames the Guildmaster directly. Since then, he’s been biding his time for revenge.
- Motivation: Jarek doesn’t care about money or guild politics; he simply wants the Guildmaster to suffer. The blackmail is his way of playing with his target, forcing the Guildmaster to jump through hoops while undermining his credibility.
- Follow-up Potential: If Jarek escapes, he could become a recurring antagonist who targets the Merchants Guild and possibly the party, seeing them as “collaborators.” Alternatively, he could become a thorn in the Guildmaster’s side, setting up ambushes or causing public disruptions.

Jareks Mercenary Band is made up of 4 other humans in total 
* 4 Level 3 Mercenarys + Jarek
