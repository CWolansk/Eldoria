Description :: As you peer into the darkness, a rancid stench fills the air, and from the shadows emerges a creature that seems stitched together from nightmares. It’s hunched and skeletal, its thin, wiry frame covered in patches of mangy fur caked in grime. Its face is rat-like yet disturbingly human, with hollow, glaring eyes that catch the light just enough to reveal rows of sharp, jagged teeth. Its limbs are long and thin, ending in gnarled, clawed fingers that twitch with a hunger barely contained. The creature's movements are jerky, like it’s held together by nothing but spite, and a slick, dark ooze drips from its mouth and claws, sizzling as it hits the ground. Every instinct screams that this thing is more than just an animal—it's something corrupted, something worshipped in the deepest, darkest places.
Alive? :: Yes
