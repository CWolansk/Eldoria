# Gunnar Ironforge

## Basic Information
**Race:** Dwarf  
**Class:** Artisan (Blacksmith)  
**Age:** 156  
**Location:** [[Stonehaven]]  
**Business:** Ironforge Smithy  
**Specialty:** Weapons and traps for frontier survival

## Physical Description
Broad-shouldered and powerfully built, even by dwarf standards. His thick brown beard is streaked with gray and often singed from forge work. Soot-stained leather apron covers practical work clothes, and his powerful arms bear countless small burns and scars from decades at the forge. His eyes are a sharp blue that seems to evaluate the quality of metal and craftsmanship in everything he sees.

## Personality
- **Gruff:** Speaks bluntly and doesn't waste words on pleasantries
- **Skilled:** Takes immense pride in his craftsmanship and reputation
- **Practical:** Creates tools and weapons designed for function over ornamentation
- **Loyal:** Devoted to Stonehaven and its protection, though increasingly concerned about the isolation

## Motivation & Goals
- **Primary:** Create the finest weapons and tools to keep Stonehaven's people safe
- **Professional:** Maintain his reputation as the frontier's most reliable blacksmith
- **Personal:** Train worthy apprentices to carry on dwarven smithing traditions
- **Current:** Supply the town guard with equipment for the increasing supernatural threats

## Background & History
Gunnar came to Stonehaven thirty years ago, fleeing political troubles in the Ironpeak Mountains. He established his smithy on the edge of town where the constant hammer-fall wouldn't disturb the citizens. His work has armed three generations of rangers and guards, and his specialized traps have kept many creatures from threatening the town.

- **Guard Weapons:** Reliable swords, spears, and armor for town defense
- **Hunting Gear:** Specialized equipment for tracking and taking dangerous creatures
- **Magical Metalwork:** Can work with unusual materials and enchanted metals (though he's not a mage)

## Attitudes Toward Party Members

- **Vanessa (Fighter):** Professional interest in her weapon preferences and fighting style; eager to discuss equipment needs
- **Justin (Merchant):** Appreciates good business sense but suspicious of "fancy city merchant tricks"
- **Others:** Generally welcoming to anyone who appreciates quality craftsmanship

## Current Concerns
The sealed gates policy is affecting his business:
- **Material Shortages:** Can't get specialty metals and components from other settlements
- **Customer Loss:** Traveling hunters and adventurers can't reach his shop
- **Apprentice Training:** Worried about being cut off from dwarven smithing networks
- **Town Defense:** Concerned about the guard's equipment needs if threats escalate

## Secrets & Knowledge
- **Metal Sources:** Knows hidden veins of quality ore in the nearby hills
- **Ancient Techniques:** Possesses knowledge of old dwarven metalworking secrets
- **Magical Materials:** Has a small cache of special metals that react to supernatural forces
- **Town History:** His predecessor left notes about unusual metal requests from previous decades

## Relationships
