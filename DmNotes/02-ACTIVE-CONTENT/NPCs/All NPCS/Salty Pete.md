## Background
Salty Pete sailed merchant vessels for two decades before age and injury forced him into land-based work. His maritime navigation skills translated surprisingly well to the underground waterways of Highreach's sewer system, where he now maintains drainage systems and water flow management.

## Personality
Pete embodies the practical sailor's approach to lifeâ€”straightforward, competent, and respectful of those who prove themselves through action rather than words. His half-orc heritage gives him natural empathy for others facing racial prejudice, though he keeps his opinions largely to himself.

## Relationships
- **JP**: Potential connection through shared maritime background and half-orc heritage
- **Exterminators Guild**: Professional courtesy but independent working relationship
- **City Maintenance**: Official employee with access to infrastructure information
- **Other Half-Orcs**: Informal network of mutual support and information sharing

## Professional Expertise
- **Sewer Navigation**: Knows water flow patterns, drainage schedules, and maintenance access points
- **Maritime Skills**: Understands tides, water pressure, and flow management from seafaring experience
- **Infrastructure Knowledge**: Access to city planning information and maintenance schedules

## Useful Information
- **Underground Geography**: Alternative routes and access points not controlled by guild
- **Water Hazards**: Knowledge of flooding patterns and dangerous drainage areas
- **City Schedules**: Information about maintenance work that might affect underground operations

## "I Know a Guy" Opportunities
- **JP Connection**: Shared maritime experience and half-orc understanding creates natural bond
- **Underground Access**: Can provide alternative routes when guild passages are compromised
- **Information Source**: Has different perspective on underground activities from maintenance viewpoint

## Plot Hooks
- Could provide crucial assistance during underground emergencies or time-sensitive operations
- Might know about unusual activity in sewer systems that guild hasn't detected
- Potential ally for operations requiring city infrastructure knowledge
