## Appearance
Tall and sturdy, sun-kissed skin from decades in vineyards, short curly brown hair, calloused hands that are surprisingly gentle with plants. Wears traditional vintner clothing with practical modifications.

## Personality
Stubborn traditionalist with deep plant wisdom, fears losing ancestral knowledge to modernization. Genuinely cares about preserving the methods that have sustained the village for centuries.

## Background
Childhood friend of [[Mayor Linden Hearthwood]], representing the old families who have worked these vineyards for generations. Mentors younger vintners in traditional methods and serves as keeper of ancestral wine-making secrets.

## Relationships
- **Childhood Friend**: [[Mayor Linden Hearthwood]] - Political tensions strain old friendship
- **Philosophical Opponent**: [[Eliza Brightwine]] - Represents everything he fears about change
- **Mentor Role**: Younger traditional vintners look to him for guidance
- **Respectful Rival**: [[Seraphina Winecraft]] - Appreciates her skill despite her innovations

## Secrets/Leverage
Knows the location of an ancient druidic shrine that might hold the cure for the current blight, but fears that using magical "contamination" would compromise traditional methods.

## Campaign Role
Guardian of old knowledge and traditional methods. His cooperation is essential for any solution that preserves village culture, and his druidic shrine knowledge could be crucial.

## Attitude toward Party Members
- **[[JP]]**: Suspicious initially due to racial prejudice but respects honest labor and physical strength
- **[[Julie]]**: Values her interest in preserving old knowledge and archaeological expertise
- **[[Claire]]**: Uncomfortable with divine magic but desperate enough to accept help if properly approached

**TODO**: Detail the druidic shrine location, traditional wine-making secrets, and mentorship relationships
