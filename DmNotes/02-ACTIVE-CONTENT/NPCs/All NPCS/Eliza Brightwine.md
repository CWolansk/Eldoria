## Appearance
Tall and slender, auburn hair tied in practical bun, green eyes that spark with enthusiasm but harden during business negotiations. Dresses in well-made but practical clothing befitting a guild representative.

## Personality
Ambitious and efficiency-focused, genuinely believes modernization will save the village and advance the greater good. Can be ruthless in negotiations but maintains professional courtesy.

## Background
Rising star within the [[Merchants Guild]], sent to Hillcrest to prove guild methods superior to traditional ones. Sees the current crisis as an opportunity to demonstrate the value of modern alchemical and magical techniques.

## Relationships
- **Superior**: Reports to [[Merchants Guild]] headquarters in [[Highreach]]
- **Professional Rival**: [[Benedict Vineward]] - Traditional vintners leader
- **Grudging Respect**: [[Seraphina Winecraft]] - Acknowledges her skill despite philosophical differences
- **Political Opponent**: [[Mayor Linden Hearthwood]] - Competes for influence over village decisions

## Secrets/Leverage
Has access to guild alchemical resources that could treat the magical blight, but won't share without concessions that would give the guild greater control over village operations.

## Campaign Role
Represents external pressure for change and modernization. Her resources could solve the immediate crisis, but at the cost of traditional autonomy.

## Attitude toward Party Members
- **[[Justin]]**: Professional courtesy but competitive; sees potential guild recruitment opportunity
- **[[JP]]**: Standard guild prejudice initially, focuses on proving usefulness over racial concerns
- **[[Liz]]**: Appreciates her perfectionist approach to problem-solving and attention to detail

**TODO**: Develop specific guild resources, modernization plans, and negotiation tactics
