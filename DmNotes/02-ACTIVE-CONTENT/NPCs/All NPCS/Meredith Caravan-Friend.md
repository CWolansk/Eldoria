# Meredith Caravan-Friend
*Traumatized Caravan Attack Survivor*

## Basic Information
- **Race**: Human
- **Class**: Commoner (former Merchant)
- **Age**: 32
- **Occupation**: Independent Trader (currently unemployed)
- **Location**: [[Fairfield]] - The Broken Wheel Inn (under protective watch)

## Physical Description

Meredith bears the visible marks of recent trauma and hardship. Once clearly a prosperous trader, she now appears gaunt and haunted, her clothes travel-stained and bearing tears from her desperate flight through the Thornwood Forest. Her auburn hair, normally kept in a practical trader's braid, hangs loose and unkempt around her shoulders. Dark circles under her green eyes speak to sleepless nights filled with recurring nightmares.

Her hands shake slightly when she's nervous, a tremor that becomes more pronounced when discussing the attack. She unconsciously touches a small scar on her left temple where a tree branch struck her during her escape. Despite her ordeal, there's still a spark of intelligence in her eyes and a determined set to her jaw that suggests she's a survivor by nature, not just circumstance.

She wears a simple brown dress borrowed from the inn's staff, as her own clothes were ruined during her flight. A small leather pouch around her neck contains the only possessions she managed to save—a few coins and a miniature portrait of her late husband.

## Personality & Motivation

### Core Traits
- **Traumatized**: Suffers from anxiety and flashbacks related to the attack
- **Determined**: Despite fear, wants justice for murdered colleagues and partners
- **Observant**: Natural trader's instinct for reading people and situations
- **Cautious**: Approaches all strangers with suspicion and wariness

### Primary Motivation
Meredith desperately wants to see the bandits brought to justice, not just for her own sake but for the memory of her business partners who were killed in the attack. She feels survivor's guilt and believes she owes it to the dead to ensure their killers face consequences.

### Secondary Goals
- Recovering some portion of her lost goods to restart her trading business
- Finding safety and security in a world that suddenly seems full of threats
- Understanding why her particular caravan was targeted
- Rebuilding her life and livelihood after losing everything

### Internal Conflicts
She's torn between her desire for justice and her fear of retaliation. Part of her wants to hide and hope the bandits never find her, while another part knows that silence only enables them to hurt more people.

## Background & History

**Early Life**: Born to a merchant family in a small town near Highreach, Meredith learned the trading business from childhood. Her parents ran a successful general goods operation, teaching her to assess quality, negotiate prices, and read market trends.

**Marriage and Partnership**: At 25, she married Thomas Caravan-Friend, a fellow trader, and they formed a business partnership that proved both personally and professionally successful. They specialized in transporting goods between smaller towns and the major trade hubs, filling a niche that larger merchant houses often ignored.

**Building Success**: Over seven years, their business grew from a single cart to a small caravan operation employing six people. They had earned a reputation for reliability and fair dealing, making them popular with both suppliers and customers.

**The Tragedy**: Three weeks ago, her caravan was attacked while traveling from Fairfield to a smaller town with a mixed cargo of everyday goods and some valuable magical components. Thomas and their four employees were killed, while Meredith escaped only by hiding under overturned cargo and then fleeing into the forest during the confusion.

**Current Situation**: She's been staying at The Broken Wheel Inn under the protective watch of Guard Captain Ironfist, though she doesn't realize her presence is being monitored. She has no money, no business, and no clear path forward.

## Key Information & Memories

### What She Knows About the Attack

**The Ambush**: 
- Occurred at dawn near the Thornwood crossing, about six miles from Fairfield
- Bandits emerged from concealed positions on both sides of the road
- Attack was professionally coordinated with clear leadership structure
- At least 15-20 attackers, all mounted and well-equipped

**The Leader**:
- Wore military-style armor that looked well-maintained
- Commanded with obvious authority and military discipline
- Had a distinctive tooth that showed when he smiled during combat
- Called by subordinates as "Sergeant" or sometimes "Chief"

**Crucial Detail**:
- Overheard bandit saying "the sergeant says to check the manifest"
- Bandits seemed to know exactly what cargo each wagon contained
- They specifically sought out the magical components she was transporting
- Someone mentioned that "the information was accurate again"

**The Escape**:
- Hid under overturned wagon when initial attack began
- Thomas fell protecting the cargo wagon where she was hidden
- Waited until bandits were distracted with looting before running
- Fled into Thornwood Forest and wandered for two days before reaching Fairfield

### What She Doesn't Realize She Knows

**The Informant Clue**: During the loading process in Fairfield, she noticed Cedric Quickfoot (the courier) examining their manifest very carefully and asking detailed questions about delivery schedules. At the time, she thought he was just being thorough, but this interaction could identify the information leak.

**The Pattern**: Her cargo included magical components that were specifically requested by a client she'd never worked with before—someone who contacted her through an intermediary and paid premium prices for rush delivery. This could indicate the bandits were using fake orders to identify valuable targets.

**The Professional Setup**: The ambush location was perfectly chosen for tactical advantage, suggesting the bandits had scouted the route extensively. This level of preparation indicates they've been operating for some time and have detailed knowledge of local travel patterns.

- **Legal Authorities**: Potential witnesses and supporters for prosecution
