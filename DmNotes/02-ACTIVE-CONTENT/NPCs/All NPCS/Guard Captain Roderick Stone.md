## Appearance
Broad-shouldered and imposing, neatly trimmed beard, sharp blue eyes that miss nothing. Wears practical guard armor maintained in excellent condition.

## Personality
Duty-bound and observant, caught between protecting the village and investigating potential sabotage. Maintains professional demeanor while under pressure from competing political factions.

## Background
Experienced guard captain who coordinates with the [[Highreach]] garrison while maintaining village security. Answers to [[Mayor Linden Hearthwood]] but faces pressure from the [[Merchants Guild]] and other external forces.

## Relationships
- **Superior**: [[Mayor Linden Hearthwood]] - Reports to but sometimes disagrees with politically motivated decisions
- **External Contact**: [[Highreach]] garrison - Coordinates regional security efforts
- **Professional Pressure**: [[Eliza Brightwine]] and [[Merchants Guild]] - Seek to influence security priorities

Law enforcement contact who can provide security support and investigation assistance. His evidence about the artificial nature of the blight could be a key plot hook.

- **[[Vanessa]]**: Military recognition and tactical discussions about village defense
- **[[Randi]]**: Fascinated by aerial reconnaissance capabilities for security purposes
