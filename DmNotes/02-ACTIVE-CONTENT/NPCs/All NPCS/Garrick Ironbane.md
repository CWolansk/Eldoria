# Garrick "Bloodtooth" Ironbane
*Disgraced Ex-Sergeant Turned Bandit Chief*

## Basic Information
- **Race**: Human
- **Class**: Fighter (Champion)
- **Age**: 38
- **Occupation**: Bandit Leader (Former Crestfall Army Sergeant)
- **Location**: Thornwood Forest Bandit Camp

## Physical Description

Garrick cuts an imposing figure that still bears the hallmarks of his military service despite months in the wilderness. Standing just over six feet tall with a powerful build earned through years of military training and recent outdoor living, he commands attention through sheer presence rather than bulk. His dark hair, now grown longer than military regulation, is kept in a practical warrior's knot, while a thick beard shows the first touches of gray at the temples.

The most distinctive feature that earned him his nickname is a pronounced canine tooth, slightly longer than normal, that becomes visible when he grins—which he does often during combat. His face bears several scars from both military service and recent bandit activities, including a notable one across his left eyebrow that gives him a perpetually skeptical expression.

His clothing combines military practicality with bandit pragmatism: well-maintained chain mail over a faded military tunic with the rank insignia removed, sturdy boots that have seen better days, and a sword belt that clearly once held commissioned officer's gear.

## Personality & Motivation

### Core Traits
- **Disciplined**: Maintains military organization and tactics despite circumstances
- **Pragmatic**: Makes decisions based on practical outcomes rather than moral considerations
- **Loyal**: Deeply committed to protecting his followers, viewing them as his new unit
- **Bitter**: Resentful toward the military system that discharged him despite years of service

### Primary Motivation
Garrick seeks to build a prosperous and secure life for himself and his followers outside the military system that failed him. He views their bandit activities as a form of warfare against a society that discarded experienced soldiers without providing alternatives for survival.

### Secondary Goals
- Accumulating enough wealth to retire his band to a legitimate life
- Proving that discharged soldiers can be successful without official support
- Avoiding unnecessary casualties while maintaining profitable operations
- Building intelligence networks that can warn of threats to his organization

### Fatal Flaw
His protective instincts toward his followers can be exploited. He will take significant risks to avoid casualties among his band, and threats to captured subordinates can force him into disadvantageous positions.

## Background & History

**Military Service**: Served 15 years in the Crestfall army, rising from common soldier to sergeant through competence and dedication. Specialized in reconnaissance and small unit tactics, earning commendations for several successful missions in border conflicts.

**The Incident**: During a patrol mission, his unit encountered civilians caught in a skirmish between kingdom forces and raiders. When ordered to prioritize military objectives over civilian safety, Garrick disobeyed direct orders to ensure the civilians' evacuation. Though the mission ultimately succeeded, his insubordination led to formal court martial proceedings.

**Discharge**: Rather than face imprisonment, Garrick accepted dishonorable discharge, losing pension rights and veteran benefits. The army's unwillingness to consider the circumstances of his disobedience left him feeling betrayed by an institution he had served faithfully.

**Bandit Formation**: Initially tried legitimate work but found that his dishonorable discharge made employment difficult. When other discharged soldiers found themselves in similar circumstances, they gravitated toward each other. What began as a support group eventually became a survival organization, and finally a professional bandit company.

**Current Operations**: For eight months, his band has targeted merchant caravans with inside information provided by contacts still sympathetic to discharged veterans. They've focused on profitable but relatively harmless operations—taking goods while avoiding unnecessary violence.
