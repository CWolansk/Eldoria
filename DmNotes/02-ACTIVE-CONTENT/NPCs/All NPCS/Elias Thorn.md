# Master Ranger Elias Thorn

## Basic Information
**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Ranger (Beast Master)  
**Age:** 38  
**Location:** [[Stonehaven]]  
**Title:** Master Ranger of Stonehaven  
**Guild:** [[Adventurers Guild]] (Senior Member)

## Physical Description
Lean and weathered from years in the wilderness, with short brown hair that's prematurely streaked with gray. A rugged beard frames his angular face, and his keen green eyes constantly scan his surroundings. Wears practical leather armor over forest-colored clothing, with a longbow always at hand. Multiple small scars on his hands and arms tell stories of close encounters with dangerous wildlife.

## Personality
- **Calm:** Rarely loses his composure, even in dangerous situations
- **Resourceful:** Can find solutions with whatever materials are at hand
- **Protective:** Deeply committed to keeping Stonehaven and its people safe
- **Observant:** Notices details others miss, both in nature and human behavior

## Motivation & Goals
- **Primary:** Protect Stonehaven from the growing threats in Blackwood Forest
- **Professional:** Train new rangers and maintain the town's defensive capabilities
- **Personal:** Uncover the truth behind Mayor Stoneheart's recent strange behavior
- **Long-term:** Establish a ranger network throughout Crestfall's frontier

## Background & History
Born and raised in Stonehaven, Elias has spent over two decades patrolling Blackwood Forest. He's witnessed the forest's gradual darkening over recent years - more aggressive creatures, unnatural weather patterns, and areas where even he fears to tread. He was instrumental in training the current generation of town guards and maintains extensive maps of safe routes through the forest.

## Forest Expertise
- **Blackwood Knowledge:** Knows every trail, stream, and dangerous area within 50 miles
- **Creature Lore:** Familiar with the habits and territories of forest inhabitants
- **Safe Routes:** Can guide parties through the forest while avoiding most dangers
- **Warning Signs:** Can read natural omens that indicate supernatural activity

## Attitudes Toward Party Members
- **JP (Half-Orc):** Respects strength and outdoor skills over racial prejudice; would judge JP by his actions in the wilderness rather than his heritage
- **Justin (Merchant):** Appreciates trade connections but worried about merchant caravans bringing dangers to town
- **Claire (Cleric):** Grateful for divine protection against supernatural threats; sees potential for collaboration
- **Julie (Archaeologist):** Fascinated by her knowledge of ancient sites; has discovered old ruins in the forest that might interest her
- **Randi (Aarakocra):** Excited to work with someone who can scout from the air; aerial reconnaissance would greatly help his forest patrols

## Animal Companion
**Shadowpaw** - A large black wolf with unusual intelligence, bonded to Elias for eight years. The wolf has an uncanny ability to sense supernatural threats and often serves as an early warning system for the town.

## Secrets & Knowledge
- **Forest Changes:** Has detailed observations of the forest's supernatural corruption over the past six months
- **Mayor's Behavior:** Suspects Mayor Stoneheart is hiding something important about the sealed gates
- **Hidden Ruins:** Knows the location of ancient structures deep in Blackwood that predate Stonehaven
- **Escape Routes:** Has prepared secret evacuation paths in case the town needs to be abandoned

## Relationships
- **[[Ingrid Stoneheart]]:** Growing tension as he questions her isolation policies and strange late-night activities
- **[[Astrid Ironfist]]:** Close working relationship; they coordinate town defenses and train guards together
- **[[Gunnar Ironforge]]:** Old friend who crafts specialized ranger equipment and arrowheads
- **[[Forest Wardens]]:** Leader of Stonehaven's ranger organization and mentor to younger scouts

## Plot Hooks & Opportunities
1. **Forest Guide:** Essential for safe passage through Blackwood Forest
2. **Investigation Partner:** Could ally with party to uncover Mayor's secrets
3. **Training Opportunities:** Can teach wilderness survival and tracking skills
4. **Ancient Site Access:** Knows locations that would interest archaeologists and treasure seekers

## Combat Statistics
**AC:** 15 (Studded Leather + Dex)  
**HP:** 84 (12d10 + 24)  
**Speed:** 30 ft  
**STR:** 14 **DEX:** 18 **CON:** 15 **INT:** 14 **WIS:** 17 **CHA:** 12  

**Spells Known:** *Hunter's Mark*, *Pass Without Trace*, *Speak with Animals*, *Barkskin*  
**Special Abilities:** Favored Enemy (Fey, Monstrosities), Natural Explorer (Forest), Beast Master companion

## "I Know a Guy" Potential
- **JP & Claire:** Fellow outdoor specialists who understand the demands of traveling and surviving in dangerous territory
- **Julie:** Could have worked with archaeological expeditions that needed wilderness guides
- **Justin:** Might have escorted merchant caravans through dangerous forest routes

## Current Concerns

2. Supernatural activity in the forest is increasing beyond normal seasonal patterns
3. Several of his ranger patrols have reported strange dreams and nightmares
4. Mayor Stoneheart refuses to discuss what specific threat requires such extreme isolation
