## Background
Vex was once a promising guild member trained by gnome masters, but left when Don Gnocianno announced the inclusivity policies. Claiming the guild had "lost its way," he established an independent pest control operation that competes directly with guild contracts while operating outside official oversight.

## Criminal Operations
- **Unlicensed Pest Control**: Undercuts guild prices using guild-trained techniques
- **Information Broker**: Sells tunnel knowledge and guild secrets to highest bidders
- **Smuggling Networks**: Uses tunnel access for moving contraband through the city

## Relationships
- **Exterminators Guild**: Former member turned bitter rival; knows internal procedures and weaknesses
- **Criminal Contacts**: Works with underground elements who resent guild cooperation with authorities
- **Competing Interests**: Potential ally for Merchant Guild members seeking to establish competing services

## Dangerous Knowledge
- **Guild Procedures**: Understands operational methods and security protocols
- **Tunnel Access**: Knows alternate routes and hidden entrances to guild territory
- **Member Information**: Has inside knowledge of guild leadership and member capabilities

## Current Activities
- **Contract Sabotage**: Interfering with guild operations to steal clients
- **Intelligence Gathering**: Monitoring guild activities for criminal contacts
- **Territory Expansion**: Attempting to claim exclusive access to certain tunnel sections

## Plot Hooks
- Guild security threat requiring investigation and countermeasures
- Potential source of information about criminal activities (for a price)
- Could be turned back to guild service under right circumstances
