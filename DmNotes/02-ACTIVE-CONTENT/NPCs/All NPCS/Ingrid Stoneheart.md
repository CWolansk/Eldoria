# Mayor Ingrid Stoneheart

## Basic Information
**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Noble (secretly Warlock)  
**Age:** 42  
**Location:** [[Stonehaven]]  
**Title:** Mayor of Stonehaven  

## Physical Description
Tall and imposing with long dark hair often pulled back in a severe style. Sharp, angular features frame piercing gray eyes that seem to see more than they should. Dresses in practical but fine clothes befitting her station, always in dark colors. A silver pendant at her throat pulses faintly with malevolent energy when she uses her warlock abilities.

## Personality
- **Authoritative:** Commands respect through force of will and strategic political maneuvering
- **Enigmatic:** Speaks in careful, measured tones, revealing little of her true thoughts
- **Desperate:** Secretly terrified of her patron's growing demands and the consequences of defying them

## Motivation & Goals
- **Primary:** Protect Stonehaven from the dark entities in Blackwood Forest (ironically, through her pact with them)
- **Secret:** Break free from her warlock pact without destroying the town or herself
- **Immediate:** Keep the gates sealed until she can resolve the supernatural threat

## Background & History
Ingrid was elected mayor six months ago after the previous mayor died under mysterious circumstances in the Blackwood Forest. Desperate to protect her hometown from escalating supernatural threats, she made a pact with a powerful entity dwelling in the forest's depths. The pact grants her power to ward the town but demands increasingly disturbing sacrifices.

## The Dark Pact
- **Patron:** Ancient fey entity known as the Thornheart, dwelling in Blackwood's deepest reaches
- **Benefits:** Can sense supernatural threats, minor divination abilities, charm effects
- **Cost:** Must perform monthly rituals that drain life from the forest, growing more demanding
- **Recent Demand:** The entity wants "fresh souls" - outsiders to feed upon

## Attitudes Toward Party Members
- **JP (Half-Orc):** Deeply suspicious due to his obvious physical strength and "outsider" status; sees him as a potential threat to town security but also as someone who might understand being judged unfairly
- **Justin (Merchant):** Wary of merchant guild connections that might bring unwanted attention to Stonehaven's isolation
- **Claire (Cleric):** Fears divine magic might detect her corruption; simultaneously hopes divine intervention might break her pact
- **Julie (Archaeologist):** Worried that scholarly investigation might uncover the town's supernatural problems
- **Others:** Views the entire party as potential complications to her delicate situation

## Secrets & Leverage
- **Hidden:** The "new mayor" story is a cover; she orchestrated her predecessor's death when he discovered her pact
- **Knowledge:** Intimate understanding of Blackwood Forest's supernatural geography and threats
- **Resources:** Can call upon minor forest entities for information or minor favors
- **Weakness:** The silver pendant is her warlock focus; removing it would break her connection but leave her powerless

## Relationships
- **[[Elias Thorn]]:** Suspects she's hiding something but respects her leadership; their relationship is strained as he notices her increasingly strange decisions
- **[[Astrid Ironfist]]:** Follows orders loyally but growing uncomfortable with the isolation policy
- **[[Thornheart Entity]]:** Her warlock patron, a manipulative fey creature that grows more demanding

## Plot Hooks & Opportunities
1. **Breaking the Pact:** Could become a powerful ally if freed from supernatural influence
2. **Forest Knowledge:** Invaluable guide to Blackwood's dangers and hidden locations
3. **Political Connections:** Has contacts throughout Crestfall's frontier settlements
4. **Redemption Arc:** Potential for character growth if party helps her find another solution

## Combat Statistics
**AC:** 12 (natural armor from pact)  
**HP:** 58 (9d8 + 18)  
**Speed:** 30 ft  
**STR:** 10 **DEX:** 14 **CON:** 15 **INT:** 16 **WIS:** 12 **CHA:** 18  

**Spells Known:** *Charm Person*, *Hex*, *Hold Person*, *Detect Magic*, *Prestidigitation*  
**Pact Abilities:** Can sense supernatural creatures within 1 mile, advantage on Deception checks involving her true nature

## "I Know a Guy" Potential
- **Claire:** Both deal with supernatural/divine forces, though from opposite perspectives
- **Julie:** Might have archaeological records of the forest's ancient history
- **Justin:** Could have merchant contacts who've noticed Stonehaven's isolation affecting trade
