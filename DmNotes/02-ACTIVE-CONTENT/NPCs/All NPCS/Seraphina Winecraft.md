Slender with long wavy auburn hair, bright green eyes, graceful movements that suggest elven ancestry. Often has stained hands from wine-making work but carries herself with quiet confidence.

## Personality
Creative perfectionist with intuitive understanding of magical wine-making. Maintains political neutrality while pursuing excellence in her craft. Serves as a voice of reason and compromise.

## Background
Master vintner whose wines contain subtle magical enhancements. Married to [[Mayor Linden Hearthwood]], making her both politically connected and professionally independent. Serves as a mother figure to younger vintners from all factions.
