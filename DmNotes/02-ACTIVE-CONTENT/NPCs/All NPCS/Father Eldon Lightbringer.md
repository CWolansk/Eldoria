Notes :: 

**Father Eldon Lightbringer** is a robust, stalwart figure in his late 50s, with the presence of someone who has weathered both storms of faith and the trials of physical labor. He stands tall, his frame broad and solid, with the kind of strength that comes not from battle but from a lifetime of hard work and dedication to his community.
Father Eldon is, in many ways, a walking embodiment of Pelorâ€™s values: a caretaker of the community, a beacon of warmth, and a soul who brings light even to the darkest corners of life.
