# Guard Captain Astrid Ironfist

## Basic Information
**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Fighter (Champion)  
**Age:** 34  
**Location:** [[Stonehaven]]  
**Title:** Captain of the Town Guard  
**Organization:** Stonehaven Militia

## Physical Description
Muscular and sturdy with a square jaw that speaks to her determined nature. Short blonde hair is kept in a practical military cut, and her steel-gray eyes reflect unwavering discipline. Multiple scars on her arms and hands show experience in real combat. Always impeccably dressed in town guard uniform with polished mail and the Stonehaven wolf emblem prominently displayed.

## Personality
- **Strict:** Maintains high standards for herself and her guards
- **Disciplined:** Follows orders without question, even when personally uncomfortable
- **Protective:** Fiercely dedicated to the safety of Stonehaven's citizens
- **Honor-bound:** Values duty and loyalty above personal feelings

## Motivation & Goals
- **Primary:** Maintain law, order, and security in Stonehaven
- **Professional:** Keep the town guard trained, equipped, and ready for any threat
- **Personal:** Prove that a frontier town can maintain military standards rivaling larger cities
- **Current Conflict:** Balance loyalty to Mayor Stoneheart with growing doubts about the sealed gates policy

## Background & History
Astrid came to Stonehaven five years ago after serving in the Highreach city guard. She was recruited by the previous mayor to professionalize the town's defenses as supernatural threats from Blackwood Forest increased. She's built the current guard from a loose collection of hunters into a disciplined military unit that could hold its own against organized threats.

## Military Leadership
- **Guard Training:** Has established rigorous training programs and patrol schedules
- **Tactical Knowledge:** Experienced in both defense and small-unit tactics
- **Equipment Standards:** Ensures all guards are properly armed and armored
- **Emergency Protocols:** Has detailed plans for various threat scenarios

## Attitudes Toward Party Members
- **JP (Half-Orc):** Initial wariness due to his size and race, but professional respect if he shows discipline and honor; might gradually warm to him if he proves trustworthy
- **Justin (Merchant):** Appreciates his organization and business discipline; sees merchant training as similar to military logistics
- **Vanessa (Fighter):** Professional kinship with another warrior; eager to discuss tactics and training methods
- **Claire (Cleric):** Respects divine authority and healing abilities; sees value in having divine protection for the town
- **Others:** Evaluates all party members for their potential contribution to town security

## Current Dilemma
Astrid is caught between her loyalty to Mayor Stoneheart and her growing concerns about the sealed gates policy. She can see that:
- Guard morale is declining due to the isolation
- Trade relationships are suffering, affecting the town's economy
- Citizens are becoming restless and asking difficult questions
- The Mayor's explanations don't fully justify such extreme measures

## Secrets & Knowledge
- **Guard Reports:** Has detailed information about increased supernatural activity in the forest
- **Previous Mayor:** Knows more about her predecessor's death than she's revealed publicly
- **Emergency Plans:** Has secret contingency plans for evacuating the town if needed
- **Military Contacts:** Maintains relationships with guards and soldiers throughout Crestfall

## Relationships
- **[[Ingrid Stoneheart]]:** Loyal but increasingly concerned about her orders and secretive behavior
- **[[Elias Thorn]]:** Close working relationship; they coordinate defenses and share information about threats
- **[[Guard Corps]]:** Respected by her subordinates, though some are questioning the current policies
- **[[Townspeople]]:** Generally trusted by citizens as their protector, but under pressure to explain the lockdown

## Plot Hooks & Opportunities
1. **Military Alliance:** Could provide training or tactical support to the party
2. **Information Source:** Has access to guard reports and town security intelligence
3. **Moral Conflict:** Might ally with party if convinced the Mayor's policies are wrong
4. **Defensive Coordinator:** Essential for organizing town defense against major threats

## Combat Statistics
**AC:** 18 (Chain Mail + Shield)  
**HP:** 72 (11d10 + 22)  
**Speed:** 30 ft  
**STR:** 16 **DEX:** 14 **CON:** 15 **INT:** 13 **WIS:** 14 **CHA:** 16  

**Special Abilities:** Action Surge, Second Wind, Fighting Style (Protection), Improved Critical  
**Equipment:** Longsword +1, Shield +1, Chain Mail, Guard Captain's insignia

## Daily Routine
- **Dawn:** Inspects guard posts and receives overnight reports
- **Morning:** Reviews patrol schedules and addresses any security concerns
- **Afternoon:** Training sessions with guards, weapon practice, tactical drills
- **Evening:** Reports to Mayor Stoneheart and plans next day's activities
- **Night:** Final security rounds before turning duties over to night watch

## "I Know a Guy" Potential
- **Vanessa:** Shared military background and fighter training could create immediate professional bond
- **JP & Claire:** Their sailor backgrounds might align with her disciplined, team-oriented mindset
- **Justin:** Merchant guild connections might have brought them into contact during trade security arrangements

## Current Orders from Mayor
1. Maintain complete lockdown - no one enters or leaves without mayoral approval
2. Increase forest patrols but avoid the deep forest "dangerous areas"
3. Report any supernatural incidents directly to the Mayor, not through normal channels
4. Prepare the guard for potential "external threats" without specifying what those might be
