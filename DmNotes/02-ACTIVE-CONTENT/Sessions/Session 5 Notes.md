#Date_04_03_496
- Party went back to their inn to sleep and level up for the night 
- We will be starting the next session with the party waking up at the inn 
	- They can go downstairs and get breakfast with everyone else 
	- the local newspaper should have an article that [[Jarek IronFist]] was found dead after falling out of a window at home and mercenary group headquarters 
		- if the party decides to go interrogate the guild master they will not be allowed to see him 
			- [[Alistair Goldman]] 
				- [[HighReach Merchants Guild]]
				- [[Evelyn Marroway]] 
	- If the group does get food then they will have to pass some constitution saving throws or get poisoned 
		- DC 12 con saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours and taking 1d6 damage 
- As the party is eating breakfast a messenger from the adventurers guild will arrive asking the party to come to the guild as soon as they can. 
	- The receptionists ask the guild to please report if they find the bodies of the nightstalkers or any clue to their whereabouts since they haven't checked in or cancelled their quest since they took it two days ago. 
		- The wives of the nightstalkers have been worried sick since they haven't come home yet and it was supposed to be a fairly easy quest 
		- they only took the quest to help out and make sure that weaker adventurers wouldn't take the quest and die needlessly 
- If they go to the adventurers guild then they will get introduced to the new gacha machine for magic weapons since they are D rank adventurers [[Random Item]] costs 5g per pull 
- After this the party can do whatever they want 
	- If they go back to the mines as they are leaving the mines for the day, the mule and cart are no where to be found.
