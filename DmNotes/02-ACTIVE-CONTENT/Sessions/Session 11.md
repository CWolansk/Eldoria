## Meeting Jon Brightman - The Legend Revealed

**Consulting the Wizard Ally**
- Party visits **[[Jon Brightman]]** to learn about the fly demon and the lich Jon
- **Strategic Omission**: Party does NOT reveal they were summoned from another world

**The Legend of Diego and Jon**

*As told by Jon Brightman:*

> Long ago, during the devastating Wizarding Wars, the kingdoms were on the brink of destruction. A hero named **Diego** was summoned to this world from another realm—he was the world's most talented swordsman. 
> 
> Diego managed to end the Wizarding Wars by defeating the lich **Jon** and sealing his powers away. He accomplished this by splitting Jon's power into multiple ancient artifacts and hiding them throughout the world.
> 
> The artifacts were protected with a crucial safeguard: only someone **from Diego's world** could unlock and retrieve them. This is why the first riddle to obtain the [[Seekers Eye]] was written in Spanish—a language from Diego's world.

**Critical Implications**
- The party realizes they are from the same world as Diego
- They were likely summoned specifically because they can unlock the artifacts
- The lich Jon has been manipulating them to collect the very items that hold his sealed power
- Each artifact they retrieve potentially makes Jon stronger

---

## Path to the Elven Kingdom

**Next Artifacts Located**
- Jon Brightman reveals the next two artifacts are in the **Silverleaf Lands** (Elven Kingdom)
- **Problem**: Entry requires special permission from an existing elven citizen

**JP's Sacrifice for the Greater Good**
- JP gives up his **[[Mantle of the Lightbender]]** to **[[Celeste]]** (elven contact)
- **In Exchange**: Travel passes for the entire party to enter the elven kingdom
- Shows JP's commitment to the quest over personal power

---

## Dr. Brule's Escape

**The Mule's Great Adventure**
- [[Dr. Brule the Mule]] successfully escaped his would-be mulenapper
- Last seen running down the main road toward [[Ardenville]]
- Justin's faithful companion remains free (for now)

---

## Hero Points Update

**Randi's Heroic Reserve**
- **Randi** has accumulated **3 Hero Points**
- Can be used for dramatic rerolls or crucial moments

---

## Key Takeaways & Consequences

**What the Party Learned:**
1. The lich's true name is **Jon** (same as their ally Jon Brightman—potential confusion)
2. Diego was a hero from their world who sealed Jon's power into artifacts
3. They are likely being manipulated to collect artifacts that will restore Jon's power
4. The [[Seekers Eye]] Jon stole is now helping him locate the remaining artifacts
5. They must race to the elven kingdom before Jon gets the next two artifacts

**Ongoing Complications:**
- City guard aware of JP and Randi looting looters
- JP's ship held as sailing race prize in Ardenville
- Guild quest to identify fly demon summoner (50 gp reward pending)
- Party must maintain secret about being from another world

**Resources Gained:**
- 120 gp split among party
- [[Robe of Useful Items]] with extensive patches (JP)
- Travel passes to Silverleaf Lands (entire party)
- Critical knowledge about Diego, Jon, and the artifacts

**Next Steps:**
- Journey to the Silverleaf Lands (Elven Kingdom)
- Locate and secure artifacts before Jon does
- Eventually reclaim The Tipsy Tankard in Ardenville
- Investigate fly demon summoning mystery

## DM Notes

- **Jon the Lich**: Centuries-old survivor of the Wizarding Wars, believes might makes right, seeks world conquest
- **Diego's Legacy**: Spanish riddles and safeguards suggest Earth-based origin; party shares this connection
- **Artifact Race**: Every artifact retrieved could potentially strengthen Jon if he obtains them
- **Name Confusion**: Jon Brightman (ally) vs Jon the Lich (antagonist)—opportunities for dramatic irony
