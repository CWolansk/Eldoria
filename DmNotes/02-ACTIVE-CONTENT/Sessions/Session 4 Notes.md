Group Ended at the adventurers guild reading the latest newspaper 
- Personal ads, missed connections. Someone looking for a half orc for a good time 
- people looking for carpenters to help repair their homes 
- some basic information about the war, with the mountains to the south serving as a natural barrier against the orc tribes  but also making it difficult for the human armies to gain any ground. 

* If the party goes and sees alistair goldman he will be too busy to see them 
	* If they wait around to see him then eventually a group of people dressed in black cloak's will exit his office and leave the guild 
	* Alistair will still be too busy, he has another meeting right away. and will refuse to meet with them. 
* If the party wants to research anything there is a general library they can go to at the adventurers guild 
	* They can find out that the dwarves and the men worked together to establish the mines, but the vein ran dry and the mines were abandoned around 10 years ago. 
	* They would also find out that the mines go about 3 level deep
	* There was a mithral vein 
	* The men and the dwarves had a couple of fights over who would get the majority of the ore 
		* dwarves think that all metal under the earth is part of their heritage and they should be paid a part of what it is all worth. 
		* The humans paid them for some but not all of the ore that was mined.
			* This is why the dwarven kingdom doesn't like the current human king
