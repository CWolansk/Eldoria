Context : Directly Follows Losing route of [[Party Ambushed by Merchant Guild Bandits]]
## **Block A: Waking & Alistair’s Greeting**

**Scene Setup:**  
The party slowly comes to in a stark, white-walled recovery room within the Adventurers Guild. Attendants in pristine robes are changing bandages and applying salves. Across the chamber, **Alistair Goldman**—a wiry man in his early 50s with slicked-back graying hair—sits calmly, arms folded. Standing at his side is a tall, powerfully built figure with a greatsword strapped across his back. A pang of recognition might flash for any character who recalls the silhouette of their previous attacker.

**Alistair (as the party stirs):**

> “Ah, you’re all awake. Good, good. My bodyguard managed to chase off those bandits who tried to abscond with your precious goblin ears—or so I’m told. Fools, really. How would they even collect the reward without the proper paperwork?”

_(He flashes a thin smile, clearly satisfied with his own remark.)_

## **Block B: Hinting at the Bodyguard’s Identity**

**If players look at or ask about the tall bodyguard:**

> **Alistair (shrugging slightly):**  
> “He’s been in my employ for some time. A quiet professional, but quite effective when the need arises. Don’t let his size alarm you; he only draws that greatsword when absolutely necessary.”

**If they suspect or outright accuse him of being related to their attacker:**

> **Alistair (raising a brow):**  
> “Goodness, do you take every broad-shouldered man to be your nemesis? Perhaps you took a harder blow to the head than the healers realized. Still, I’m grateful he showed up when he did.”

## **Block C: Alistair’s Subtle Leverage**

_(Once the party is somewhat settled, Alistair rises from his chair and approaches.)_

> **Alistair:**  
> “I’m sure you have questions. But first, let’s be practical: your injuries are tended, your possessions safe. Courtesy of me, you might say. Healing fees at the Adventurers Guild don’t come cheap. I consider it a small investment.”

_(He gestures to the attendants, who politely step out, leaving only the party, Alistair, and his bodyguard.)_

## **Block D: Why Alistair Really Saved Them**

**If a party member inquires what Alistair wants:**

> **Alistair (smiling thinly):**  
> “You’re a canny lot, so I won’t spin a fairytale. I’ve heard rumors about a certain item rumored to lie at the bottom of the Highreach Mines. Very valuable, so they say. I believe you’ve proven you can handle yourselves—aside from a minor mishap here or there.”  
> _(He inclines his head, as if referencing their latest scuffle.)_  
> “I’d like you to find it for me. Payment, of course, will be commensurate with the risk.”

## **Block E: The Offer**

**Alistair explains his proposed deal:**

1. **Healing Fees Waived**
    
    > “I’ve already seen to your injuries. Let’s call that a down payment.”
    
2. **Initial Reward**
    
    > “But if that is not enough, perhaps there is some sort of equipment that you need, a new sword perhaps to give you an edge in your next encounter against those bandits?”
    
3. **Up to 1,000 Gold Each**
    
    > “If that doesn’t move you, I have deeper coffers. Say, **1,000 gold each** upon delivery of the artifact. That is more than than you'd get handing it over to those wizards to study, or to the Adventurers guild, for what do they give you, good adventurer points? Yes that will put food on the table and armor on your backs.”
    
## **Block F: Verbal Nudges & Threats**

**During Negotiation**, Alistair might say:

> “I’d hate for your assets—like that fine mule the merchants guild so graciously gave you—to come to any… unfortunate end. These streets can be so unsafe, wouldn’t you agree?”

## **Block G: The Outcome**

**If the Party Agrees**

> **Alistair (brimming with satisfaction):**  
> “Excellent. In that case, I’ll leave you to rest up and gear yourselves properly. I have matters to attend to, In Ardenville I'm sponsoring the sailing competition you know. But do keep me informed. I’ll expect good news.”  
> _(He and his guard depart, leaving the party in relative peace.)_

**If the Party Refuses**

> **Alistair (smile fading):**  
> “A grave mistake, I assure you. But it’s your decision. The mines can be treacherous; let us pray you return in one piece.”  
> But if you do change your mind, I will be in Ardenville overseeing the sailing competition and festival.
