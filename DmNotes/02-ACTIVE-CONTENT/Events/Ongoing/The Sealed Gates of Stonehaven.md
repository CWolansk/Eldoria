# The Sealed Gates of Stonehaven

## Event Overview
**Type:** Political Crisis with Supernatural Elements  
**Location:** [[Stonehaven]]  
**Duration:** Ongoing (6 weeks)  
**Threat Level:** High  
**Status:** Escalating

## Situation Summary
The frontier village of Stonehaven has been under complete lockdown for six weeks, with Mayor [[Ingrid Stoneheart]] ordering the gates sealed and all external contact forbidden. Guards turn away travelers, merchants, and even Adventurers Guild members, citing "external threats" that require extreme security measures. The isolation is causing economic hardship, social tension, and political complications throughout the region.

## The Real Situation
Unknown to most residents, Mayor Stoneheart has made a warlock pact with an ancient fey entity called the **Thornheart** that dwells in the deepest reaches of [[Blackwood Forest]]. The pact was made in desperation to protect the town from increasing supernatural threats, but the entity's demands have become increasingly sinister. The sealed gates serve multiple purposes:

1. **Contain the Corruption:** Prevent supernatural taint from spreading beyond Stonehaven
2. **Hide the Evidence:** Keep outsiders from discovering the warlock magic and unnatural phenomena
3. **Control the Sacrifice:** The Thornheart demands "fresh souls" - outsiders to feed upon
4. **Buy Time:** Give the Mayor time to find a way to break the pact before it consumes the town
