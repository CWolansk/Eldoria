A celebration of the Everwood itself, where elves gather to honor the ancient trees and the natural world around them. On this night, the Everwood glows with magic as the elves perform ancient, intricate dances beneath the moonlight. The Sylvan Dance is a quiet, mystical celebration where music and nature blend, reminding the elves of their deep connection to the world. This event occurs every 5 years.
