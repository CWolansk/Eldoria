During this vibrant celebration, the elves hold a three-day event under the glow of a rare celestial alignment, where the moons shine brightest. Art, music, and arcane performances take center stage, with artisans and mages showcasing their finest works. It's a festival of creativity and expression, a time when even the most reclusive elves come together to celebrate their cultural achievements. Every 3 years.
