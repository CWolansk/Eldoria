A grand festival where elves honor their ancestors and the elders of their people. This is a time for storytelling, where the history and wisdom of the elven race are passed down through generations. Itâ€™s also a period of reflection, where the elves reconnect with their past and share their visions for the future. Sacred groves are visited, and ancient songs are sung in reverence. This occurs every 10 years
