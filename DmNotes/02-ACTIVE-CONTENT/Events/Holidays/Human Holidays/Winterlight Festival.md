Winterlight is a solemn but hopeful celebration, symbolizing endurance and the return of light. In the darkest days of winter, towns are illuminated with lanterns and bonfires, and families gather to share stories and gifts. It’s a time of reflection, honoring ancestors, and preparing for the challenges of winter ahead. It’s also believed that spirits roam more freely on this night, so offerings are made to keep them at peace.
