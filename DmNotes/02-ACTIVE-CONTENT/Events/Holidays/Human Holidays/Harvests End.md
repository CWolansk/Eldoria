As the final harvest is brought in, the people gather to honor the bounty of the earth. There are massive feasts in every town and village, with the best produce of the year on display. This is also a time to reflect on the hardships of the year and prepare for the coming winter. Offerings are made to the gods for protection during the cold months.
