A sacred event in orcish culture, where the tribes come together to hunt the most fearsome beasts in the Orcish Wastes. This is a trial of bravery and endurance, where only the strongest orcs venture out. The hunt is more than survivalâ€”it's a way to earn respect within the tribe and a chance to gain favor from the gods.
