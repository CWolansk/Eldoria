Whenever a new Warchief takes control of a tribe, a massive feast is held to mark the change in leadership. This is not just a celebration of power but also a demonstration of the Warchiefâ€™s strength and their ability to provide for their people. Roasted game, mead, and fire pits dominate the feast, and the new Warchief challenges the tribe's best warriors to duels of strength.
