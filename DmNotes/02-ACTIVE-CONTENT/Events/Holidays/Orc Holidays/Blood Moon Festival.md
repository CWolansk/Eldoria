Orcs celebrate the Bloodmoon as a time of renewal and power. On this night, the tribes hold ritual combat, with warriors fighting to prove their strength and dominance. The sky turns red with the Bloodmoon, and itâ€™s believed that the spirits of fallen warriors watch over the fights, blessing the strongest among them. Tribes exchange weapons and stories, and the night is filled with chants and drums.
