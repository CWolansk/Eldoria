This is a personal and guild-wide celebration when a young blacksmith finishes their first true masterpiece. The blacksmithâ€™s forge is blessed by the elders, and their work is displayed proudly in the grand halls of Forgepeak. Festivities include competitions in forging, with dwarves showing off their skills in smithing and crafting. It is considered a rite of passage for a dwarf.
