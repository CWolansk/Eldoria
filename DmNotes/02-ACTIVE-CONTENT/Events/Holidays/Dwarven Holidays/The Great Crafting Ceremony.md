A massive, kingdom-wide celebration of dwarven craftsmanship, this event brings together the finest artisans, smiths, and builders in Ironpeak. Legendary creations are unveiled, and competitions of skill and endurance are held. Itâ€™s an opportunity for young apprentices to showcase their abilities and for the older dwarves to pass on their knowledge. The culmination of the ceremony is the forging of a monumental artifact in honor of their patron deity, Moradin.
