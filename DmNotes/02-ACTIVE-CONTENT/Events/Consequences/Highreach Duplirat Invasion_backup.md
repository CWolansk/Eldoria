---
The city of Highreach is being invaded by duplirats coming from the sewers that the party failed to take care of causing expensive damages. The party must choose where to help in the city.

Consequences of the results of [[Goblins in the Mine]] earthquake caused by [[Session 9 Notes]] 

Each round is 10 in game minutes Scenario ends at round 10
Each player gets 2 actions 
- move
- attempt minigame 
- Assist an ally (give advantage in a minigame)
- other (heal, cast spells, scout, get information for help)

> DM Quick-Run Summary (7 players, level 5)
> - Threat tokens (count toward Loss): Fire (F), Looters (L), Rats (R). Goal tokens: Evac (E). Gates are objectives in Sewer zones.
> - End of round worsen: roll a d8 for zone and a d6 for status (1–2 Fire, 3–4 Looters, 5–6 Rats). Castle is excluded from these rolls; Market is included. If a result is illegal (e.g., Looters in a Sewer Gate), reroll the zone.
> - Zones (d8): 1 Wizard, 2 East Sewer, 3 Poor, 4 South Sewer, 5 Middle, 6 West Sewer, 7 Rich, 8 Market.
> - Zone is Lost at 3+ threat tokens (any mix of F/L/R). Evac there are casualties unless currently escorted.
> - Default for this big table: roll 2 different zones to worsen each round (reroll duplicates). Drop to 1 if pacing drags.
> - Adjacency: Ring (Wizard → East Sewer → Poor → South Sewer → Middle → West Sewer → Rich → back to Wizard). Market connects to all ring zones. Castle is a safe hand-in hub (no tokens; excluded from worsen).
> - Starting state: East/West/South Sewer: Gate + 1 Rats; Poor/Middle/Rich: 1 Evac; Market: 1 Looters & 1 Fire; Wizard: 2 Fire; Castle: Safe.
> - Hard Mode tweaks (optional): raise table DCs by +1 (e.g., Gate base DC becomes 17); keep 2 worsen rolls/round.
> - Movement rules (fast): Free move to an adjacent zone that currently has no threat tokens (F/L/R). If moving into a threatened zone (has any tokens) or while Escorting, roll once on the Movement table. Lost zones are hazardous: see Movement Rules below. If a worsen roll selects a Lost zone, reroll the zone.
> - Random Events: resolve after PC actions each round and before worsen. They never add or remove tokens. Each event is either Global (everyone rolls) or Targeted (only affects PCs engaged in that minigame this round). Targeted events only apply to PCs in qualifying zones; if none, ignore the event.

End of each round: roll a d8 for zone (see list above) and a d6 for status (1–2 Fire, 3–4 Looters, 5–6 Rats). Castle is excluded from zone rolls; Market is included. If a result doesn’t make sense, reroll the zone. If the selected zone is Lost, reroll the zone. Any zone with 3+ threat tokens (F/L/R) is overrun and Lost.

### Movement Rules (Simple)
- Free Move: If the destination has no threat tokens (no F/L/R), move to 1 adjacent zone without a roll.
- Threatened Move: If the destination has any threat tokens or you are Escorting, roll once on the Movement table as normal.
- Lost Zones (Hazardous Transit):
  - Entering: Make one Movement check at +2 DC. On success, you may only pass through (no douse/chase/recruit/escort in that zone this turn). On failure, take 1d6 damage (fire/bludgeoning, DM’s choice), are pushed back to your prior zone, and lose your next action.
  - Ending your turn in a Lost zone: Con save DC 12 or take 2d6 fire damage and have disadvantage on your next check.

## Mini Games 
### Rats
- Rat tokens will spawn randomly unless every sewer gate is closed
- If the sewer gate area is lost the rat spawning moves to another area 
### Sewer Gates 
- The Sewer gates at each end of the town have broken open from swarms of frantic rats. You must find a way to force the grates closed again or find other means to block the exit.
- Each rat token within a sewer gate zone raises the DC to close the gate by 2
- A gate can be closed with 2 successful strength checks DC 16 + 2(# rat tokens)

### Fires
- Through accident or as a distraction, fires have started around town collect townspeople to join your bucket brigade and put out the fires
	- Make charisma checks or similar to gather townspeople
	- 10 -> 1 person 
	- 15 -> 2 people 
	- 20 -> 3 people etc 
- Each person within a bucket brigade (including players) add 1d6 to a water pool
- Using an action anyone within the zone can instruct the group to douse a fire
	- roll all of the dice in the water pool 
		- 15 or higher puts out 1 fire token 
		- 25 or higher will remove all fire tokens from a zone 
- *Optional* : use magical or other means to put out the fires without a bucket brigade

 -

## Escort 
- The old and vulnerable population of the town are stuck within their houses, too afraid to leave for fear of being eaten or trampled. Collect these townspeople and deliver them safely to the castle. 
- Movement becomes harder in a group. Roll on the random movement table for groups and pass the check 
- *Optional* : use magical or other means to protect or escort the townspeople
