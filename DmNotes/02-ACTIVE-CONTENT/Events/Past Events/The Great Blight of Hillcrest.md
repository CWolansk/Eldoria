## Event Overview
Forty-three years ago, Hillcrest faced a devastating supernatural blight that threatened to destroy the village's vineyard economy. Unlike the current crisis, this historical incident was resolved through successful collaboration between local druids, visiting scholars, and village traditionalistsâ€”establishing both precedent for magical intervention and the community traditions that now complicate the current situation.

## Timeline of Events

### Initial Outbreak (Spring 282 AC)
- Strange fungal growth appeared overnight in three separate vineyard sections
- Traditional remedies failed completely within first week
- Village elders debated whether to seek outside magical assistance
- Economic panic began as 30% of spring plantings showed infection

### Escalation Phase (Early Summer 282 AC)
- Blight spread to cover 60% of village vineyards within six weeks
- Desperate village council voted to request aid from traveling druids
- Initial druidic intervention slowed but didn't stop the spread
- Archaeological team from Highreach University arrived to investigate historical parallels

### Collaborative Research (Mid-Summer 282 AC)
- Druids and scholars discovered blight was magically enhanced natural disease
- Investigation revealed source: corrupted ley line intersection beneath oldest vineyard
- Solution required combining druidic purification rituals with scholarly ward-crafting
- Village traditionalists initially resistant but eventually agreed to magical intervention

### Resolution Phase (Late Summer 282 AC)
- Three-day ritual combining druidic nature magic with protective ward anchors
- Complete purification of infected vines and soil restoration
- Establishment of permanent magical monitoring crystals (still used today)
- Successful harvest saved village from economic collapse

## Key Participants

### Village Leadership
- **Aldric Hearthwood** (Mayor Linden's grandfather): Led village council during crisis
- **Master Vintner Garrett Vineward** (Benedict's father): Initially opposed magical intervention but became advocate after seeing results
- **Guard Captain Thormund Stone** (Roderick's predecessor): Coordinated security during vulnerable period

### External Experts
- **Druid Circle of the Ancient Oak**: Provided nature magic expertise and purification rituals
- **Highreach University Archaeological Department**: Contributed historical research and ward-crafting knowledge
- **Royal Agricultural Advisors**: Monitored situation for kingdom-wide agricultural security

### Village Supporters
- **Seraphina's grandmother, Elara Winecraft**: Pioneered integration of magical monitoring into traditional wine-making
- **Various families**: Many current village leaders trace their cooperative attitudes to this shared experience

## Magical and Technical Details

### The Original Blight
- **Nature**: Fungal infection magically enhanced by corrupted ley line energy
- **Symptoms**: Rapid vine deterioration, soil corruption, resistance to normal treatments
- **Spread Pattern**: Followed underground magical energy flows rather than natural disease vectors

### The Solution
- **Druidic Component**: Purification rituals to cleanse corrupted natural energy
- **Scholarly Component**: Permanent ward anchors to prevent future ley line corruption
- **Integration Method**: Magical monitoring crystals that alert to supernatural agricultural threats

### Long-term Consequences
- **Positive**: Established magical agricultural monitoring system still in use
- **Negative**: Created expectation that magical problems require magical solutions
- **Cultural**: Generated village tradition of welcoming outside magical expertise

## Relevance to Current Crisis

### Parallels to Current Situation
- Both blights resist traditional agricultural remedies
- Both show patterns suggesting artificial enhancement of natural diseases
- Both threaten village economic survival and social stability
- Both occur during periods of increased regional tension and artifact-seeker activity

### Key Differences
- Current blight shows different magical signatures and spread patterns
- Village now has three competing factions rather than unified leadership
- Political complexity prevents rapid decision-making that was possible 43 years ago
- External pressures from guild politics complicate outside assistance

### Historical Lessons
- **Successful Collaboration**: Previous crisis was resolved through cooperation between traditionalists and magical experts
- **External Expertise Value**: Outside knowledge proved crucial to understanding and solving the problem
- **Long-term Benefits**: Magical monitoring system prevented several smaller incidents over subsequent decades
- **Cultural Integration**: Village learned to blend traditional methods with magical enhancement

## Research Opportunities for Party

### Archaeological Investigation (Julie's Expertise)
- University records contain detailed documentation of the previous investigation
- Physical evidence of ward anchors and ritual sites still exist in village
- Comparison between historical and current blight patterns could reveal important differences
- Previous archaeological team's notes might contain clues about regional magical phenomena

### Historical Knowledge (General Research)
- Village elders remember the crisis and lessons learned
- Guild records show how previous cooperation was structured and funded
- Druidic contacts might still exist from the original intervention circle
- Royal agricultural reports document the kingdom-wide implications

### Magical Analysis (Randi's Knowledge)
- Original monitoring crystals still function and contain historical magical data
- Ward anchor locations could be tested for current effectiveness
- Ley line corruption patterns from 43 years ago can be compared to current magical signatures
- Previous ritual sites might still hold residual magical energy relevant to current cure

## Political Implications

### Faction Reactions to Historical Precedent
- **Traditionalists**: Point to successful cooperation as model while fearing loss of autonomy
- **Modernists**: Use historical magical intervention as justification for current guild solutions
- **Moderates**: Cite previous collaboration as proof that balanced approach works best

### Current Resistance Factors
- Guild politics didn't exist during previous crisis, creating new complications
- External pressures from artifact seekers add security concerns absent from historical situation
- Village prosperity has made some residents resistant to change that desperation previously made acceptable

## Campaign Integration Notes

This historical event provides:
- **Precedent** for party magical intervention being welcomed by some villagers
- **Political complexity** as different factions interpret the lessons differently
- **Investigation opportunities** for party members with appropriate backgrounds
- **Solution hints** for the current crisis while maintaining unique challenges
- **Character development** opportunities as party members learn to work with existing village power structures

The Great Blight serves as both historical context and potential roadmap, while the changed political situation ensures the current crisis requires fresh approaches and party-specific solutions.
