	- The party talks to Alma and she thanks them and gives them the map of eldoria

		- [[Nightstalkers Collection Quest]] 

will take place in [[Session 7 Notes]] when the party tries to leave the adventurers guild after being treated there by [[Alistair Goldman]] 
or the next time that the party enter the adventurers guild 

**Route 1: After Treatment (Alma's Gratitude & Request)**

- **Setting:** The party is leaving the medic ward after being treated by [Alistair Goldman](obsidian://open?file=NPCs%2FAll%20NPCS%2FAlistair%20Goldman.md). Alma Ironfist approaches them, her eyes filled with gratitude. The other widows are nearby, watching.
    
- **Dialogue:**
    
    - **Alma:** "Adventurers, thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving Thoren. He's told us everything about what happened in the mines. We were so worried... We don't know how to repay you, but please accept this." (She hands them a high-quality map of the continent.)
    - **Alma (Continuing):** "There is one more thing... While we are overjoyed to have Thoren back, the loss of our other husbands is still a heavy burden. Each of them had a prized possession, something that meant the world to them. It would bring us some peace to have those items returned. Would you be willing to help us with this?"
    - **(If the party agrees):** "Thank you. Celeste is looking for Rolf's bear fur mantle, Brenna seeks Tomlin's longbow, and Fiona desperately wants Oren's warhammer. Any help you could provide in recovering these items would be greatly appreciated."

**Route 2: Next Guild Visit (Alma's Gratitude & Request)**

- **Setting:** The party enters the Adventurers' Guild. Alma Ironfist spots them and approaches, a grateful smile on her face. The other widows are nearby.
    
- **Dialogue:**
    
    - **Alma:** "Adventurers! It's you! Thank you again for saving Thoren. We can never truly repay you for bringing him back to us. Please, accept this as a small token of our gratitude." (She hands them a high-quality map of the continent.)
    - **Alma (Continuing):** "Thoren has told us of your bravery and skill in the mines. While we are so grateful to have him back, the loss of our other husbands is still a heavy burden. Each of them had a prized possession, something that meant the world to them. It would bring us some peace to have those items returned. Would you be willing to help us with this?"
    - **(If the party agrees):** "Thank you. Celeste is looking for Rolf's bear fur mantle, Brenna seeks Tomlin's longbow, and Fiona desperately wants Oren's warhammer. Any help you could provide in recovering these items would be greatly appreciated."

**After Alma's Dialogue (Both Routes):**

- The party can then speak to each of the other widows individually to learn more about their husbands' prized possessions and potentially receive additional information or incentives.
