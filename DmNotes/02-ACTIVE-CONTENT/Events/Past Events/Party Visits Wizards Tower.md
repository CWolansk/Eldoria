Based on your notes from [[Session 1 Notes]], here's what happened when the party visited the wizard's tower:

*   After resting at the [[Sturdy Mugg]] inn, the party decided to get some information from the local wizards guild.
*   The wizard's tower glows during the day and has ornate marble flooring and a receptionist. The inside is larger than the outside, and doors to wizards' studies appear when they have appointments.
*   The party met [[Jon Brightman]] 
*   Jon gave them information about the seeker's eye and the wizard that created it.
	* [[Seekers Eye]] 
*   Legend tells that the seeker's eye is an ogre's eye that was poked out and turned into an artifact of great power that can be used to find other artifacts like a compass and was created by another wizard named Jon.
