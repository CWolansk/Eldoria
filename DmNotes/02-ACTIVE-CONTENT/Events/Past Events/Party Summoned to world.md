Opening Act: Accidental Summoning and Immediate Danger

- The Summoning: The campaign begins with the party being suddenly transported to the world of Eldoria by a powerful summoning spell gone awry. They find themselves in an unfamiliar environment and are immediately attacked by lesser demons that were also summoned in the process. The party must quickly band together to survive this initial encounter.
- The Wizard’s Deception: After defeating the demons, the party is approached by an illusion of the wizard, who presents himself as a powerful but distant sorcerer in need of their help. He claims that he summoned them to Eldoria to retrieve an artifact from the bottom of the Highreach Mines. According to the wizard, this artifact is essential for stopping a great evil, and only those pure of heart—such as the party—can bypass the magical shield protecting it. He instructs them to seek refuge in the nearby city of Highreach and suggests they disguise themselves as adventurers, mentioning that they might even earn some money by taking on quests related to the mines.
- Arrival in Highreach: The party makes their way to the city of Highreach, where they can interact with the Adventurers’ Guild, meet key NPCs such as Guild Master Thaldrin Stormblade and King Alaric Stormhelm, and gather supplies. They learn that the Highreach Mines have become a dangerous place, infested with goblins and dark creatures, and that many adventurers have entered the mines only to never return.
You sit down at the table and introduce your character, after everyone has introduced their characters..

A flash of bright white light fills the room, when your eyes clear you're standing in a clearing within a dark forest. On the ground are symbols pulsing red in a circle surrounding all of you. Looking around you can see that all of the characters you just heard described are standing and looking around at their surroundings as well. From the dark edges of the trees you can see small flashes of red glowing light that looks similar to the glowing symbols beneath your feet. As you start to wonder what those flashes might be dark shadows stalk from the treeline toward you.

- Roll Initiative
- 2 spined devils
- 2 imps

Once the fiends are defeated, a ghostly illusion of a kindly old man appears before you.

"Hello adventurers, I apologize for the weaklings that were accidentally brought to this plane along with you but I can see that you have emerged victorious. I have summoned you to this world from your own to help me save this world from corruption and destruction. The war between the orc tribes and humans has gone on far too long, I require your help to retrieve an ancient artifact that help me end the war once and for all, restoring peace to this land for all time! Before I go further I must know, will you help me?"

*Point to one specific person and then point to each other person repeating the same phrase*

"Excellent! Now I need you to retrieve an artifact called the Seekers Eye, unfortunately I am rather occupied in another plane at the time so I cannot obtain it myself. The eye is protected from dark forces by an ancient spell that repels all but the pure of heart, which I am sure you adventurers will have no problem getting past! The eye resides at the bottom of the highreach mines beneath the city of highreach, it is infested with goblins and other dark forces trying to find a way to obtain the eye for themselves.

The city of highreach can serve you well as a base to rest, buy supplies and earn money through the local adventures guild. Good luck Adventurers I will contact you again when you have the Eye!"
