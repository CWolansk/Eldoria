#Date_13_03_496 #Subquest

Justin's mule [[Dr. Brule the Mule]] bolted from Highreach after the invasion. Hoofprints along the main road lead toward the Ardenville crossroads. Recovering the mule may reveal clues about Diego and prevent traders from selling him.

TODO : Dr.Brule was captured by looters but was able to kick his way out and escaped. The party should be able to find him at a crossroads. We need to expand on this situation. If they look for dr.Brule in [[Highreach]] They should eventually hear some rumours of a mule that was seen running along the main road. They may be able to catch up if they hurry.
