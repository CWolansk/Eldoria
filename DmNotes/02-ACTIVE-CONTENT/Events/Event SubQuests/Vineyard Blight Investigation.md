#Date_13_03_496 #Subquest

Rumors spread that Eastvale's grapevines are succumbing to a strange necrotic blight. Investigating the fields could uncover a link to darker magic seeping from the Blackwood or Jon's schemes.

TODO : I don't know when this is going to happen, this event is ongoing for when the party arrives at [[Fairfield]] but this should be the town level quest

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID file.link AS "Mentioned In"
FROM [[#this.file.name]]
SORT file.name ASC
```
