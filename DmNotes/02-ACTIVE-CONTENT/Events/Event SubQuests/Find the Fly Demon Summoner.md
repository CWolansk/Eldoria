## Quest Overview

**Quest Giver**: [[Adventurers Guild]] / [[Guild Master Thaldrin Stormblade]]  
**Reward**: 50 gp  
**Status**: ✅ **SOLVED - Ready to Turn In**  
**Difficulty**: Medium  

The [[Adventurers Guild]] needs to identify who summoned the fly demon that attacked [[Highreach]]. The party must investigate the summoning and discover the culprit's identity.

## ✅ QUEST SOLVED

**The Summoner**: **Jon the Lich**

After consulting with [[Jon Brightman]] during [[Session 11]], the party learned that the fly demon was summoned by **Jon the Lich** as part of his coordinated attack on Highreach. The demon attack served as a distraction and created chaos to cover his theft of the [[Seekers Eye]] from the mines.

**Next Step**: Party needs to return to [[Guild Master Thaldrin Stormblade]] at the [[Adventurers Guild]] to report their findings and collect the 50 gp reward.
