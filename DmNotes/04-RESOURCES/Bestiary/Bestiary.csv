It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, except those against wind. The cloud form is immune to nonmagical damage other than that from sunlight.A creature that starts its turn in the cloud must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. If the save fails, the creature takes 13 3d8 poison and 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and becomes poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned.After 24 hours, corpses of beasts or humanoids that were in the spore area rise as zombies loyal to the ancient corpse walker.

This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

It otherwise uses the target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.The exchange lasts until the target's body or the savant's body is reduced to 0 hp, the savant ends it as a bonus action, or the savant is forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the exchange ends, the target returns to its body, regaining control, and the savant's soul returns to its body, which is no longer paralyzed. The target is immune to this savant's Soul Exchange for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the exchange ends.","","","","","","","Underdark",""

Envelop. While grappling a creature, the mimic uses their Shapechanger action to polymorph into an object that is the same size or bigger than the grappled creature (if the mimic isn't already in such a form). The creature is then enveloped by the mimic. An enveloped creature is no longer grappled, but they can't breathe, are blinded and restrained, have total cover against attacks and other effects outside the mimic, and take 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the mimic's turns. When the mimic moves, the enveloped creature moves with them. The mimic can envelop one creature at a time.An enveloped creature can use their action to try to escape by making a DC 13 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature is no longer enveloped and is shunted to an unoccupied space of their choice within 5 feet of the mimic. The creature automatically escapes if the mimic uses Shapechanger or Panic Shift, becomes incapacitated, or dies.","","Panic Shift (1/Day). When the mimic takes damage, they release any grappled or enveloped creatures and then polymorph into a Small dense object with spikes, such as an iron ball or helm. While in this form, the mimic's walking and climbing speeds are doubled, they have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from mundane attacks, they can only take the Dash, Disengage, or Shapechanger action, and a creature who touches the mimic or hits them with a melee attack while within 5 feet of them takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage. This effect ends when the mimic dies or uses their Shapechanger action to polymorph into another form.","","","","","",""
