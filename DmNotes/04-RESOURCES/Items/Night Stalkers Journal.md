### **Entry 1 

^bdf833

The first entry can be found in the [[Room 10 Level 1]] crumpled within a red cloak, and partially hidden off to the side 

"I don’t have long. The droning won’t stop—it’s drilling into my head. The goblins are twisted beyond reason, all thanks to that creature lurking deeper in. We called ourselves the Nightstalkers; now I’m the only one left alive, if you can even call this living.
Whoever finds this, I beg you to be stronger than we were. The buzzing’s getting louder—gods, it’s everywhere. I won’t see daylight again, but maybe you still can end this."
### **Entry 2

^7a93db

Found in [[Room 3 Level 2]], hidden off to the side, also in a torn red cloak. This note looks similar to the one found above and has similar rushed hand writing.

We crawled through tight backways—snuck behind the guard instead of bashing the door in.
Couldn’t solve the Stupid dwarven riddle door Tomlin said something about a second key.
The Big iron door was left open, looking back it was most likely a trap by the Fly. But we had to keep moving forward, for the wizard. 

  

Dwarves sit up on the highest peak

though others often look down

we left our anvils heat

right quick for the metal crown
