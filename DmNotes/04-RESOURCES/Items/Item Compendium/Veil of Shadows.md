**Text:**  This midnight-black cloak seems to drink in the light around it, shimmering faintly like rippling water when viewed from the corner of your eye. The edges are embroidered with dark silver thread in a pattern of swirling mists, and the fabric is unnaturally cool to the touch. When worn, it cloaks the wearer in subtle darkness, muffling footsteps and making their movements blend seamlessly into the shadows. Whispers of unseen voices seem to follow the cloak, as though the shadows themselves are eager to aid its master.
  - **Shadow Stab (Bonus Action, 1/day):** Your next melee weapon attack deals an additional 2d6 necrotic damage. If made while hidden, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your Dexterity modifier + proficiency bonus) or become frightened of you until the end of its next turn.
- **Concealed Escape (Reaction, 1/day):** When you take damage or are targeted by an attack, you may become invisible until the start of your next turn and move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
