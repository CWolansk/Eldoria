- **Elemental Surge (Action, 1/day):** Choose an element (fire, cold, lightning, acid, or poison). Creatures within a 10-foot radius of a point you choose within 30 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Wisdom modifier + proficiency bonus). On a failed save, they take 2d8 damage of the chosen type and suffer one of the following effects:
    - **Fire:** Target ignites, taking 1d6 fire damage at the start of their next turn.
    - **Cold:** Movement speed is reduced by 10 feet.
    - **Lightning:** Cannot take reactions until the end of their next turn.
    - **Acid:** Armor/shields take -1 penalty to AC.
    - **Poison:** Target is poisoned until end of next turn.  
        _Damage increases to 3d8 at 5th level, 4d8 at 11th, 5d8 at 17th._
- **Elemental Ward (Action, 1/day):** You summon an aura within 20 feet for 1 minute. Allies in the aura are immune to being frightened or charmed. If they were already affected by either condition, it ends when the aura activates.
