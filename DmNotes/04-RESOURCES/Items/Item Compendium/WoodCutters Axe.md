**Text:**  This rugged hand axe is engraved with runes of efficiency and nature's bane, its blade gleaming with an unnatural sharpness.
- You have **advantage on attack rolls against plant-type creatures** (such as shambling mounds, treants, or awakened trees).
- Additionally, this axe can fell any **non-magical tree** with a single swing, regardless of size or density. The enchanted blade slices through wood effortlessly, leaving behind perfectly clean cuts and no trace of resistance. This makes it highly prized among lumberjacks, druids with grudges, and adventurers clearing overgrown terrain.
